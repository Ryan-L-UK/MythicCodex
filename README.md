# Gods, Demigods, Deities & Patrons

## Alaundo

Alaundo arrived at Candlekeep in the Year of Clinging Death, 75 DR. Where he'd come from, nobody knew; his peers presumed he'd been raised in one of the port cities of the Sword Coast, after various offhand remarks he'd made. Much else about him was a mystery. What was known was that he'd come to read the works of others, thanks to his great interest in books. Although some sources stated that Candlekeep was originally the citadel of Alaundo, and he was remembered as one of its founders, he in fact had only a small and humble tower, about which much of Candlekeep grew. The precise location of this tower was lost over the centuries and in the many other towers built since.

While there, Alaundo added significantly to the Roll of Years, the grand list of prophetic names of years past, present, and future first developed by the Lost Sage Augathra the Mad centuries earlier, and extended it many centuries into the future. As such, he created how years were handled in the Calendar of Harptos. Alaundo and Augathra both based their work on the predictions of past diviners, including those of a seer from past ages whom they referenced as "the T Source", and a centuries-long corpus of elven lore and prophecies, and expanded on them with their own predictions. While a number of historians criticized Alaundo and Augathra alike as mere plagiarists who'd appropriated elven lore and claimed the credit, others would hail them as visionaries who tried to aid later generations with their forewarnings and encouragements. A tradition at Candlekeep held that Alaundo had seen future events in his dreams, but needed multiple and repeated dreams to put them exactly in order. It was told by some that he'd been inspired by gods, or even that he was an avatar of a god himself. In fact, he was but the final follower of the then imprisoned and fading God Savras the All Seeing, who showed him visions only of that which would come to pass. As for Alaundo himself, he only ever knew it as "the Voice", an unidentified presence within him that inspired his prophecies. In his own words, Alaundo simply said "It has been given to me to see glimpses of the future, moments of the measureless time that lie ahead..."

Yet among the earliest of Alaundo's prophecies known to be fulfilled was first foreseen by another and enabled by Alaundo himself. At the time, the monks of Candlekeep sought a means of protecting the library from fire, vermin, and deliberate destruction, but had not settled of any solution. Then Alaundo prophesied that a young man, the first of many, would give himself to the library and become a part of it forever, forming a guardian entity that would protect Candlekeep from darkness and evil. The probationer Bairn asked for an audience with Alaundo the Seer, who to his surprise quickly accepted. Bairn revealed he'd had a similar vision a tenday earlier, wherein a divine messenger told him such a guardian required the life of one who truly believed in what Candlekeep stood for, but Bairn had doubted worthiness and kept it to himself. After hours of discussion, Alaundo left Bairn alone in his private chambers. When he returned and resumed holding audiences, Bairn was gone and Alaundo only smiled and declined to answer what had become of him.

Near the end of his life, Alaundo would prophesy even the date of his own death. Three days before the end, in the Year of Windsong, 76 DR, he was still hard at work writing them down. Ironically, adventurers in the far future would look back through time at him, while peering through a time portal in a mousehole in his tower.

After Alaundo died, Candlekeep became a place for the preservation and study of his prophecies, and indeed of all knowledge. Known collectively as the Prophecies of Alaundo, the monks would keep safe his prophecies among their vast collection of writings, and even chanting them ceaselessly night and day as they walked around the citadel under the direction of the Chanter and their three assistances, the Voice of the North, the Voice of the East, the Voice of the South, and sometimes the Voice of the West. When the Keeper decreed a particular prophecy had been fulfilled, it was removed from the Endless Chant, so it grew steadily shorter, though this could take some time to decide, for some prophecies were still chanted years after their mostly likely fulfilment. They ended their pronouncements with "So sayeth the wise Alaundo." Occasionally, one of the Avowed of Candlekeep would abruptly stop and stare and utter a cryptic prophecy in an unfamiliar voice, believed by many of them to be "the spirit of Alaundo rising within". While they would exclaim "Alaundo Speaks!", such prophecies were never accepted in the Endless Chant.

His skull became a priceless relic venerated by the faithful of Deneir, Oghma, and Savras and by the Avowed of Candlekeep. It was said that the bearer of the skull could speak directly with Alaundo using a speak with dead spell, no matter how many centuries has passed. In fact, Alaundo existed as a Weaveghost tied to his skull, which he could speak through when he wished, though he'd lost his prophetic ability.

However, Alaundo's skull was stolen shortly after his death and was lost. It was greatly sought after by the illithids of Oryndoll, who followed every clue to its supposed location. Around 1370 DR, there were rumours of it being up for sale in the market in Llorbauth, Erlkazar, after being retrieved from a fire drake lair in the Deepwing Mountains, caused an increase in illithid activity on the southern shores of the Deepwash. As for the skull, by 1373 DR, it was apparently kept in a box somewhere, carefully watched over. Alaundo's Weaveghost lingered on into the late 15th century DR.

## Bargrivyek

In many campaign settings for the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, Bargrivyek is the goblin deity of cooperation and territory. He is known as the Peacekeeper because he tolerates no war between goblin tribes. However, he is not a gentle god and he desires to see goblins destroy their enemies, particularly orcs.

Bargrivyek appears as a large (8 feet tall) goblin with a high domed forehead. He wears a calm expression and carries a white-tipped flail.

Bargrivyek is on good terms with the goblins' racial god, Khurgorbaeyag, because both desire the rise of goblins to domination of other races. He fears the head of the goblin pantheon, Maglubiyet, as well as the god of the hobgoblins,Nomog-Geaya.

Hruggek urges Maglubiyet to act against Bargrivyek, because Bargrivyek seeks to unite goblins and bugbears, something Hruggek disapproves of.

Bargrivyek's deceptively titled realm of *The Peacable Lands* can be found on Avernus, the first layer of Baator. Here he trains his goblin armies and leads raids against the realm of Kurtulmak, god of the kobolds.

Shamans of Bargrivyek strive to reduce conflicts amongst the goblins and turn aggression outwards toward external foes. They also advocate the expansion of goblin territory. Their holy weapon is the flail.

Bargrivyek sends omens to his clergy in the form of falling stars, speaking in strange tongues, and speech following violent stuttering.

## Shadow Mover (Cat)

All cats possess a part of the Shadow Mover in their souls. That predatory grace which cats display, even as they roll in leaves or bat at an overhanging flower with their paws? That’s the Shadow Mover. The strange expression of peace which suffuses a cat’s face as it readies to spring on prey, even if that prey is only a sunbeam? That’s the Shadow Mover. The Shadow Mover is the essence of feline lethality, the quintessence of that part of every cat which is a hunter. Usually imagined as a vast, ever-shifting black phantom, seeping round corners, identifiable only by the glint of golden eyes. Few cats directly praise or worship the Shadow Mover, but all revere him and long to see their reflection in those placid, golden eyes as they leap to the attack. The Shadow Mover never intervenes in the world, never defends or assists his children. To do so would be to grant unfair advantage to the predator, and the prey must have a chance. To this most mysterious of deities, there is no joy in a hunt guaranteed of success. The hunt is a game, a contest, and the Shadow Mover wants his children to be the best at it. To intervene would defeat the purpose. A true cat must hunt by itself.

## The Old Striped One (Cat)

The most mysterious of the cat deities is undoubtedly the Old Striped One. He has no more definite name than this peculiar sobriquet and, whenever he is mentioned, cats close their eyes as though asleep. The Old Striped One is invoked both as a protector of cats and as a possessor of strange and hidden knowledge. While most feline gods are thought of as being loners, the Old Striped One maintains a court of friends — which, according to the scant clerics of the god, includes mice, birds, and other creatures which are traditionally food for cats. This results in clerics of the Old Striped One being thought of as a little odd amongst their kin. They are, however, those most capable of bringing cats together and use their influence and gentleness to ensure that their god’s message — that all species must endeavour to live together in harmony — may one day see fulfilment.

## Tom O’th’Alley (Cat)

Cats are mysterious, enigmatic creatures. It is no surprise that they should worship a god whose very nature is equally uncertain. Tom o’th’Alley is a mercurial deity; sometimes charming and seductive, sometimes capricious and cruel. Such is the nature of a trickster god and Tom o’th’Alley is most certainly a trickster. Of all the Ailurokin, it is Tom who is most often seen by awakened cats. He generally takes the form of a large, ginger feline with bright green eyes. These eyes are always gleaming with something like mischief, always friendly, always welcoming — even if Tom is yowling loudly at just the wrong time, bringing an irate human with a cleaver after you. Tom is not always ginger, of course. What self-respecting trickster god wants to be fixed in one shape forever? Certainly not Tom. As a result, all followers of Tom treat every cat they meet with a wary respect, who knows when they might meet the great thief himself?

## Urbaste (Cat)

Acknowledged by all cats to be the head of the pantheon and the most powerful of the gods, Urbaste is beloved by almost all cats and is the most widely worshipped member of the Ailurokin—the name for the deities worshipped by felines. Some cats believe her to have once been mortal and proclaim her ‘great mother,’ tracing their lineage back to her. Others believe that all forms of cat were once unified in Urbaste but that, as she aged, she began to decay and fall to pieces. Her left-arm, as it dropped from her, became the lion, her right-leg became the tiger, and eventually, when nothing else was left, her heart became the first cat. Who knows what the truth is? What is known is that Urbaste now reigns over the Fields of Yarn - a cat heaven, where everything can be played with, chased, and chivvied. Her followers worship her through acts of ‘cat-ness’, whether that be chasing a mouse, stealing food, creeping over roof tops at night…all are considered tributes to Urbaste. While she adores her children, Urbaste is not a huge fan of humanoid races, considering them to be frequently cruel to her offspring.
