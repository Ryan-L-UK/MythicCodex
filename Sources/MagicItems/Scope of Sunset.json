  "I0D": "This is a part of the legendary Sunset rifle, a fabled weapon forged long ago as a tool for wielding light against the darkness. Also known as 'radiant piercer', it did greater damage the further the targets alignment was from lawful good.",
  "I1H": "",
  "I1D": "The Sunset was last rumoured to have been wielded by a great elven hero Alaine Greenleaf, but was feared too powerful and split into three pieces.",
  "I2H": "",
  "I2D": "This is the scope, a perfectly crafted and balanced telescopic sight cradled in ornate gold metalwork. The sight has the ability to both zoom in and out, making it the perfect scope for any and all forms of combat. The scope has an over engineered and complicated mounting system which ensures it will only ever work with Sunset."
