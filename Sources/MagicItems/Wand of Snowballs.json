While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the Snilloc's snowball swarm spell (DC 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 2nd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.","I1D":"The wand regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge,  roll a d20.
