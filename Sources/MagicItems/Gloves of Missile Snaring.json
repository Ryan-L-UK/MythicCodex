When a ranged weapon attack hits you while you're wearing them, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by {@dice 1d10} + your Dexterity modifier, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand."],"lootTables":["Magic Item Table F"],"hasFluffImages":true}
