With the wand in hand, you can use your action to cast one of the following spells from the wand, even if you are incapable of casting spells: {@spell ray of frost} (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level; +5 to hit with ranged spell attack), {@spell sleet storm} (3 charges; spell save DC 15), or {@spell ice storm} (4 charges; spell save DC 15). No components are required. The wand regains {@dice 1d6 + 1} expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 20, the wand melts away, forever destroyed."],"attachedSpells":["ray of frost","sleet storm","ice storm"],"hasFluffImages":true}
