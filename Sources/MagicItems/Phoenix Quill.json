  "I0D": "This is a standard quill and serves no additional purposes. The legend tells that the phoenix who supplied the feather only ever gave three feathers. Two feathers were gifts to those who were worthy, and one was forcibly taken by one who was jealous. Legend tells that since that day the phoenix left Faer√ªn never to return."
