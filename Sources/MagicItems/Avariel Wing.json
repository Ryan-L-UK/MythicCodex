  "I0D": "This white feathered wing could easily be confused for an angel wing, however it actually belonged to an Avariel at one point. The wing itself is in perfect condition despite the fact it is organic and has clearly been removed for some time.",

  "I1D": "The wing itself has no obvious use, the feathers could be used for a quill or even a cloak. If the wing were to be reunited with its owner it could be grafted back on and probably work perfectly, although without its twin, it would make for a decidedly one sided Avariel."
