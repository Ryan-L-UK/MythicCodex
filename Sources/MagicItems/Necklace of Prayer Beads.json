A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast, that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.",{"type":"table","colLabels":["{@dice d20}","Bead of...","Spell"],"colStyles":["col-1 text-center","col-2","col-9"],"rows":[["1-6","Blessing","{@spell Bless}"],["7-12","Curing","{@spell Cure wounds} (2nd level) or {@spell lesser restoration}"],["13-16","Favor","{@spell Greater restoration}"],["17-18","Smiting","{@spell Branding smite}"],["19","Summons","{@spell Planar ally}"],["20","Wind walking","{@spell Wind walk}"]]}],"attachedSpells":["bless","cure wounds","lesser restoration","greater restoration","branding smite","planar ally","wind walk"],"lootTables":["Magic Item Table G"],"hasFluffImages":true}
