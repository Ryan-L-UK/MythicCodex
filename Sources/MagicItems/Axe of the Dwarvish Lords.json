Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol.","Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the {@italic Brutal Pick}, the {@italic Earthheart Forge}, the {@italic Anvil of Songs}, and the {@italic Shaping Hammer}. With them, he forged the {@italic Axe of the Dwarvish Lords}.","Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.","Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.",{"name":"Magic Weapon","type":"entries","entries":["The {@italic Axe of the Dwarvish Lords} is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
