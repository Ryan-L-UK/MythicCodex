Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the Crook of Rao -potentially for the final time.",{"type":"entries","name":"Random Properties","entries":["The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}:",{"type":"list","items":["2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} properties","1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial} property","1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} property"]}]},{"type":"entries","name":"Spells","entries":["The crook has 6 charges.

Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent {@spell gate} spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.",{"type":"table","caption":"Extraplanar Reversal","colLabels":["d100","Effect"],"colStyles":["col-2 text-center","col-10"],"rows":[["1-25","A portal to a random plane opens.
