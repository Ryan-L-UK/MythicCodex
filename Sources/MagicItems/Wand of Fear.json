While it is {@condition frightened} in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the {@action Dash} action or try to escape from an effect that prevent it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the {@action Dodge} action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success."]}],"attachedSpells":["command"],"lootTables":["Magic Item Table G"],"hasFluffImages":true}
