Some languish as prisoners, souls so wicked mortals dare not free them upon an unsuspecting afterlife.","Created by a figure of Vistani legend, Luba's Tarokka of Souls shaped the destiny of countless heroes. The prophecies of this deck of cards also revealed great evils and guided its creator into the path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck's creator, Mother Luba, narrowly escaped doom, spared only by her keen insights. But even for her, not all wickedness could be escaped. In the most dire cases, Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings of pure evil amid the strands of fate, imprisoning them within her tarroka deck. There these foul spirits dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foul—as it inevitably will.","Like all tarokka decks, the {@i Tarokka of Souls} is a lavishly illustrated collection of fifty-four cards, comprising the fourteen cards of the high deck and forty other cards divided into four suits: coins, glyphs, stars, and swords.",{"type":"entries","name":"Random Properties","entries":["The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}:",{"type":"list","items":["2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} properties","2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} properties"]}]},{"type":"entries","name":"Spells","entries":["While holding the deck, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: {@spell comprehend languages}, {@spell detect evil and good}, {@spell detect magic}, {@spell detect poison and disease}, {@spell locate object}, or {@spell scrying}.

She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness and resilience-ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures of the night. \"We may wander amid the shadows,\" Mother Luba said. \"But we must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers.\"","Some years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only the Tarokka of Souls.
