On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition deafened}. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take {@damage 10d6} thunder damage instead of {@dice 5d6}.","Each use of the horn's magic has a {@chance 20} chance of causing the horn to explode.
