ADVENTURES
expert treasure hunters
Old Took’s great-granduncle Bullroarer ... charged the ranks of the goblins of Mount Gram in the Battle of the Green Fields, and knocked their king Golfimbul’s head clean off with a wooden club.
His passion for history reignited by recent events, Bilbo studies the Old Took’s map and discovers a clue concerning the where- abouts of the lost club of the Bullroarer. At once, he organizes a trip into the Northfarthing, where the clue seems to point. After questioning the Hobbits of Oatbarton, the quest leads them further into the North Moors, and deeper into danger.
This adventure can be played at any time after the events of A Conspiracy Most Cracked, but before Invol- untary Postmen. If played in sequence, it is now the spring of the year S.R. 1360.
part one: on the road again
With their efforts to purloin the Old Took’s map having been successful, Bilbo is delighted. He invites everyone to stay for several days as his guests at Bag End, during which time they live in the lap of luxury. Though they never want for food and drink, Bilbo remains locked up in his study, before eventually coming out on the afternoon of the second day.
Popping out of his study like a cuckoo from a clock, Bilbo rushes into the parlour where you are all relaxing after a fine second breakfast, map still clutched in his hand. “My wonderful friends! You won’t believe what I’ve found on the Old Took’s map: I believe I know where the club of Ban- dobras Took is located! Or at least the Old Took did. Or rather he thought he did. Maybe he wasn’t sure.” He shakes his head, as if to physically force the rambling thoughts from his head. “Never you mind. I might need to do a bit more research, but I was hoping for — nay, counting on your help once again!”
“After hearing all about your little adventure in Michel Delving, I’d like a taste of adventure myself. It says here on the map that the club of the Bullroarer may be somewhere around the village of Oatbarton, in a place called Kings- worthy! Exciting, isn’t it? So, I was thinking perhaps in return for my generous hospitality, we could take a walk north and do a bit more investigating into the matter. Imag- ine it, being credited with being the Hobbits who found the club of Bullroarer Took! Wait right here, I’ll run and get you the right gear to suit a proper adventure!”
And like that, Mad Baggins disappears in a flash around the corner before returning as you all exchange looks of excitement and confusion. He drops a large chest before you, and smiles. “There you are! Take what you need. There’s no knowing where we’ll be swept off to!” He turns to dash off again but turns around back to you, almost laughing at his own forgetfulness. “I’ve muddled my wits, staying up all night making a copy of the Old Took’s map. No need to damage the original, after all!” He shoves the fresh copy at you before throwing open the front door to Bag End and stepping out onto the road. “Come on!” he cries, “We’d best be off!”

    BILBO’S GEAR

Before setting out for Oatbarton, the characters can draw from the equipment contained in the old trunk provided by Bilbo. It contains basic travelling gear such as cloaks, backpacks, pocket handkerchiefs, other standard supplies, and few battered weap- ons. Among the weapons are three clubs which can also serve as walking sticks, a pair of small hunting bows left behind by Dwarvish visitors (with arrows), a short sword he had used for decoration instead of warfare, a small axe for cutting wood, and one dagger for each of them. Sting is not among the weapons, as it is carried by Bilbo.
OATBARTON INVESTIGATION
To go to Oatbarton, the conspirators must first take the road to Bywater to the south, and reach the East Road. Then, they enter the Eastfarthing leaving behind the Three-Farthing Stone, and take the Northway Road to their left. It’s more than a leisurely stroll to reach Oatbarton, taking more than three days on average, but searching for the fabled club of Bullroarer Took is certainly worth the effort (to enliven the journey, the Loremaster can use the rules for Hobbit Walks found on page 10 of The Shire).
It’s almost midday when the conspirators catch sight of the first houses of the village. It is spring, but the last hints of winter still nip at their toes, making them particularly eager for a hearty meal. Even before they take their first steps into the cobblestone courtyard that serves as the heart of the vil- lage, they catch the scent of roast chicken and potatoes! The hard-working farmers of Oatbarton are gathered in the centre of their village for their lunch, sitting at long tables, shaded by large pavilions and tents. The search for the famous war hero’s great club can wait...
The villagers are happy to share their lunch with the Player-heroes, and as soon as they place a plate in front of each of them, they start asking questions about what their business may be so far north. Luckily for them, they are not shy about answering questions themselves, especially if they concern local history.
Gathering information about the Bullroarer and a place called Kingsworthy requires 3 successful Skill rolls, using AWE, COURTESY, ENHEARTEN, PERSUADE, or RIDDLE.
The conspirators can pose their questions in any way they see fit, but any Player-hero who fails a roll cannot make any more rolls to inquire further. The Loremaster can spread the information described below among the Player-heroes, so that each of them uncovers a new clue and they can piece together the information as a group.
♦
♦
♦
Upon a first success, the Player-heroes learn that the ‘Kingsworthy’ is an abandoned structure, about a day’s
travel into the North Moors.
A second success allows the Player-heroes to learn that some of the rowdier local children play a game called
“Bullroarer’s Club” that seems to involve them rough- ing up one another with a stick from the field they claim to be the artefact.
A third and final success means they hear some rumours about a ghost haunting the abandoned Kingsworthy.
KINGSWORTHY
Kingsworthy can be reached by taking a northward path from Oatbarton, and walking for a full day across the North Moors (see also The Shire, page 30 and beyond, for more about Kings- worthy and travelling across the North Moors).
Once it is in sight, the Player-heroes may attempt to identify the purpose of this large stone house and round tower with a roll of LORE. On a success, they conclude that it might have been a hunting lodge at the time of the Kings in Norbury.
Upon a closer inspection, the conspirators find the place to be deserted. They find evidence of it having been used as a shelter by wanderers, but it certainly isn't inhabited regularly.
They spot a fresher set of tracks. A successful roll of SCAN reveals that they quite clearly belong to one or more Hobbits.
But the most important find of the day is that no club hangs over the large mantelpiece of Kingsworthy, but probably used to. Above the cold fireplace is a large wooden plaque, bear- ing the signs of having been used to display a long object, as tall as a Hobbit.
Careful examination and a successful CRAFT roll reveals that something was mounted on the plaque and was removed. A wooden chair sits near the fireplace, as if someone used it to reach the spot above the mantelpiece.
Could the club have been stolen recently?

ADVENTURES
TRACKING A THIEF IN THE NIGHT
The most likely course of action for the Player-heroes is to set themselves to following the tracks they identified inside Kingsworthy. Luckily for them, they are easily followed, as the individual leaving them is moving with great haste.
Unbeknownst to the conspirators, they are following the tracks of one Mort Mudfoot, a farmer of Oatbarton. He is after his daughter Myrtle, who disappeared yesterday after having heard everyone in town talking about the club of the Bullroarer — a very competitive player of Goblin Nocking, a game involving balls, holes and the use of clubs, Myrtle left town with the intention of securing for herself the ‘most famousest’ club in Hobbit history, before some stranger took it. Thinking this ‘Kingsworthy’ place to be much closer to her home, she pressed on anyway, until she reached it, finding that a club was indeed hanging over its mantelpiece. Having found her prize, she took it and set off on her way home. She is now wandering across the North Moors, her father looking for her.
The Player-heroes can catch up with the beleaguered father by succeeding in 3 HUNTING rolls. When they do so, they spot the lean, brown-haired Hobbit, des- perately following the tracks of his daughter as fast as he can find them.
If asked about the club of the Bullroarer, Mort will say he doesn’t know anything about it but that Myrtle does love to play Goblin Nocking with the other children, and that must be why she came all the way out here this morning. A life-long resident of Oatbarton and a reasonable Hobbit in his sixties, Mort is beside himself with concern. Myrtle is his only child, and he fears even returning home to tell his wife Marigold that she is missing because of how panicked she will become.
Determined to find her no matter what it takes, Mort will accept any help he is offered. He will tell little stories about his daughter to any of the Player-heroes that will listen. He speaks of how adventurous she has always been, her love of the stories of the Bullroarer, and how she dreams of explor- ing places beyond Oatbarton.
part two: shadows and rumours
The quest for the club of the Bullroarer has led the Player- heroes into the North Moors, and now they are out there at night, in search of a missing Hobbit girl. As they scour the land, strange and potentially dangerous obstacles reveal themselves.
Myrtle Mudfoot
The Loremaster can read or paraphrase the following text.
The night is clear and cool. A waxing moon and a veritable symphony of starlight offers some light as you trek across the lightly rolling landscape. But this is no well-trodden road. The ground is uneven, and your foot can easily be caught in a hole or your legs grow weary as you plod through the moss-covered terrain. A long yawn escapes your mouth and you fight off the weight of your own eyelids — all the while searching for signs of the wayward Hobbit lass. Even in this dim evening light, the growing concern is evident on Mort’s drawn face.
The Player-heroes are pressing into the small hours of the night, without any real opportunity to rest or recover. As such, they all gain 3 Fatigue Points. They can reduce the gain with a TRAVEL roll (a success reduces the total Fatigue of a Player-hero by 1, plus 1 point for each Success icon ).
INTO THE NORTH MOORS
As the Player-heroes scour the North Moors for some sign of Myrtle, the Loremaster should ask them how they are going about doing so, and determine which skill is appropriate based on their preferred methods.

    ExPERT TREASURE HUNTERS

Those attempting to identify an area where she may have tried to find shelter in the night may make an ExPLORE roll.
Characters looking for signs of where Myrtle may have wandered in this wide landscape can make a HUNT- ING roll.
Those looking for signs of anything out of the ordi- nary can attempt a SCAN roll.
ExPLORE. Clever Player-heroes may consider that Myrtle must have sought shelter somewhere in the wilderness instead of wandering around in the dark. With a success- ful roll, the Player-heroes do indeed discover the remnants of a camp, but only with one or more Success icons do they notice that it’s set up so skilfully that it can’t be the work of a child. It even has a small fire pit, hand dug and ringed with stones.
HUNTING. A success allows the Player-hero to notice that Myrtle’s meandering set of tracks is not leading her back to Oatbarton. She is definitely lost. One or more Success icons allows the characters to recover a tiny scrap of a pretty yellow dress, which Mort confirms as being a colour that matches the one Myrtle was last seen wearing.
SCAN. A success reveals that there is another set of tracks following those of Myrtle. With one or more icons, the tracks are identified as large, booted footprints that do not belong to any Hobbit.
Following this last set of tracks is easier than expected, and does not require any further rolls. If the Player-heroes follow, after a while they even seem to be able to make out the sil- houette of a wanderer just on the edge of their vision, always barely in sight. Player-heroes succeeding in a roll of RIDDLE realize that, given the figure’s long stride and apparent skill at woodcraft, it is likely remaining in sight intentionally and actually leading them.
A FATHER’S AID
Mort can help the Player-heroes. He is sharp-eyed — One single Player-hero searching for evidence
of Myrtle gains (1d) to their rolls.
part three: dawn be stone!
The climax of this adventure occurs once the Player-heroes follow the tracks they are after to the edge of a wide patch of shrubland, where an unexpected adversary hides among ancient ruins.
The Loremaster can read or paraphrase the following text.
Hours of pursuit mean that when you see the darker patch of bracken and heather ahead, the sky has started to turn from the deep blackness of night into the deep blue of the hours before dawn. You’ve followed Myrtle’s tracks for miles now. You’ve little doubt that she came this way. As you get closer, you start noticing that the dark patch is not due simply to a different vegetation — there are ancient stones jutting out of the ground, low crumbling walls hinting that this once was a very different place. A fort, a town maybe. Few Hobbits have seen this place, and as you take your first steps forward among the stones, stories of kings and armour-clad warriors fill your mind.
Just as you and your fellow conspirators are about to explore the heather-covered ruins, a rumbling growl seems to rise from the ground itself! It’s a bellowing shout bear- ing some resemblance to human speech, echoing among the ancient stones. You then hear a high, panicked voice call out from nearby: “Shoo you old Troll! Go away! Go!” Breaking through a thicket of brambles, you see none other than Myrtle Mudfoot, who has scrambled up a ruined wall and is swinging a heavy wooden club at a massive creature looking like the grotesque imitation of a large Man — it’s a Stone-Troll! Between the two of them, leaning wearily against a wall, is a cloaked stranger, hood thrown back to reveal the rugged face of a Man with grey eyes, clutch- ing a large, bleeding gash across his shoulder that has all but incapacitated him as he desperately tries to keep the monster from reaching the child. The Troll is clearly angry, and does not seem to have noticed you and your compan- ions. Myrtle, on the other hand, sees you and immediately cries out for help.
Fighting an angry Stone-Troll is quite a dangerous endeavour, as the cloaked stranger has just found out. The creature is large and powerful, but quite stupid. If the Player-heroes take on the Troll head to head, he fights ferociously, though he flees once he’s Wounded or has lost half of his Endurance.
If the Player-heroes attempt to trick the Troll with some clever stratagem, they may succeed in buying enough time and allow the light of the dawn surprise the creature.

ADVENTURES
To trick the Troll, the Player-heroes need to accumu- late at least three successful Skill rolls, using HUNT- ING, RIDDLE, or SONG. The Troll hesitates, confused, and does not attack for as long as the Player-heroes succeed at their rolls. Upon the first failure, the Troll becomes enraged and attacks the nearest Hobbit with a Favoured attack roll (no more attempts at trickery are allowed).
If the Player-heroes achieve three successful Skill rolls, the Troll is surprised when the first rays of the sun hit the clouds above — suddenly terrified, the Stone-Troll breaks away from the fight, looking for shelter. If the Skill rolls achieved two or more Success icons , the Troll is completely caught unawares by the dawn, and is turned to stone on the spot!
epilogue
With Myrtle rescued, she is delivered by the wanderer and the Player-heroes back to her father Mort, who rejoices. It is then that the cloaked Man reveals his identity.
The Loremaster can read or paraphrase the following text.
Throwing back his hood, with one arm clutching his shoul- der, the cloaked wanderer reveals himself. He has long grey- brown hair and bright, steely eyes. He smiles through the pain of the wound he suffered at the claws of the Troll. “It is not often that I find myself needing protection. Less often that it should come in the form of you little, wondrous folk. It would seem I still have much to learn.”
“My name is Halbarad, and I am a Ranger, although that title may not tell you much. Suffice it to know that I, like yourselves, was searching for young Myrtle for two

reasons. First, for fear that she might find true danger. Sec- ond, because she took something I was meant to guard. I cer- tainly didn’t expect a burglar like Myrtle, and she fooled me.”
“What Myrtle took from Kingsworthy is indeed a rare relic, a token of an ancient past, best forgotten. It was hid- den in plain sight, and has remained safe for a long time, until today. But now I think I have found someone worthy of its safekeeping. I think that if you have it, it may be in better hands than mine.” He chuckles softly and his hard eyes brighten a bit. “Now, if you would be so kind as to see the Mudfoots home, I am certain they have a fine meal waiting for them. I have wounds to tend to, but I hope this will not be our last meeting.” He turns without wait- ing for a reply, and in a matter of seconds the shadows of the heath swallow up the Ranger as if he were one of their own, and he is gone.
Once back at Oatbarton, Mort explains to his wife Marigold what happened. She chastises him as only a wife worried sick can, but prepares a grand feast for everyone as a thank you for their efforts. After a fine meal and a long sleep, the Player- heroes can begin their journey back to Bag End, with the club of the Bullroarer hidden among their gear.
To their surprise, as they come up the lane of Bagshot Row, they see a Dwarf in a red hood peeking into the window of Bag End. He turns at their approach and casts off the hood, revealing a keen smile and a long white beard.
“Bilbo, you old rascal! You told me to drop by for tea any time and here I am!” The Dwarf pauses with a grin and collects himself before offering a polite smile. “Forgive my exuberance. Balin, son of Fundin, at your service.” With a bow, he casts
THE BULLROARER’S CLUB
Bandobras “Bullroarer” Took used this massive club to win the Battle of Greenfields and defeat the Goblin war- lord Golfimbul. Legend has it that one blow from the great club knocked the Goblin chief’s head off and sent it sailing into a far-off rabbit hole — winning the battle and inventing the game of golf at the same time! At the end of the adventure, Bilbo will keep the club at Bag End for study, and he will later donate it to the Mathom-house of Michel Delving, for everyone to admire.

ADVENTURES
most excellent fireworks
The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought by him, but designed and made by him; and the special effects, set pieces, and flights of rockets were let off by him.
Once again, the affairs of the Shire and those of Gandalf the Grey seem to be entwined. To better understand the nature of the Grey Pilgrim’s wizardry — and for a bit of fun — Bilbo asks the conspirators to find out what became of the last of Gandalf’s fireworks, left over from the Old Took’s birthday parties. The conspirators must travel to the Yale and discover what became of them.
This adventure can be played at any time after the events of A Conspiracy Most Cracked, but before Invol- untary Postmen. If played in sequence, it is now the summer of the year S.R. 1360.
part one: unexpected party favours
The conspirators are gathered in Bag End for yet another fine dinner on the lawn beside the Hill, when the horizon to the south-east suddenly lights up with a display of dazzling colours! You can see thin tendrils of smoke curling up in the darkening sky. Bilbo bolts upright and snaps his fingers.
“Those have to be Gandalf’s old fireworks! What are they doing with them?” Before you can say so much as ‘pop and hop,’ Master Baggins is already planning a new mission, to set off and retrieve what he calls ‘the last of Gandalf’s party favours.’ He informs you that years ago, Gandalf entrusted the remainder of his fireworks to none other than Primrose Boffin, now Bracegirdle, Lobelia’s own mother. Primrose, who went to live in Hardbottle after her marriage, recently moved back to the Yale, where she was born, setting off all sorts of gossip. Now, judging by where those dazzling lights seemed to come from, someone in the Yale must have tried to put those fireworks to use again and may have set a fire going with them. Bilbo continues: “Fireworks are not things to be handled carelessly. And if they won’t be responsible then I know a safe place for them!”
Balin, who has turned a visit for tea into a stay of sev- eral days, offers to join the Company as he’d like to get to know the Shire a bit more.
A YALE YARN
This adventure can dispense with the Hobbit walk required to bring the Player-heroes to their destination, by having them start the game already in the Yale. Their walk had them fol- low the East Road all the way to Whitfurrows.
After asking for directions several times (or following Lobelia’s, if she’s present), they reach the Boffin family estate late in the morning, several miles south along the road that leads from Whitfurrows to the Stock Road and the Woody End. It’s a large farmstead, recently renovated, composed of a stately house surrounded by farm buildings, in the middle of wheat and barley fields and orchards. There are scorch marks in a couple of the fields and a larger one closer to the house. A rutted lane between low hedges leads to the front door.

    Once they knock at the door, it flies open, and you see the rather sour face of Primrose Bracegirdle greeting you.

“Aye, what do you want?”
As it is immediately clear, Primrose is not terribly glad to
have visitors, not even her own daughter, especially after she’s been wandering around the Shire in questionable Company. When asked about the fireworks, she says that her son Bruno came to visit last week and was fooling around with them. After Bruno set a few off to entertain the local children, she put a stop to all that nonsense and sent him back to Hardbot- tle to store the blasted things back at her husband’s house. If they reveal that they have come so far specifically to retrieve the fireworks, Primrose assures them that possession is the greater part of the law, and if they want them, they’ll have to buy them properly.
WALKS AND WANDERINGS IN WHITFURROWS
The trip back to Whitfurrows is an easy walk, but by the time the Player-heroes arrive, it is late afternoon, and most of the trading is done for the day. After a bit of looking and asking around among the throng of traders, they find Bruno drink- ing in the company of a Dwarf mason. Bruno is about fifty, and looks very much like a meaner and larger version of his younger sister Lobelia.
When asked about the fireworks, Bruno is initially ada- mant that he has no idea what they’re talking about. He is suspicious of anything that has to do with ‘Mad Baggins’, and if Lobelia is present, he reprimands her for getting involved in such ‘adventurous nonsense’.
Bruno can be coerced into revealing the truth with a successful Skill roll (AWE, PERSUADE, or RIDDLE are all appropriate).
On a success, he tells the Player-heroes that he passed the fire-
works off to one of the Hobbits working for his father Blanco — one Otho Sackville-Baggins, who agreed to take them back to Hardbottle, after a stop in Scary for a pint. If the roll is
a failure, Bruno just says that he sent the fireworks home.
STORMS IN SCARY
Setting off north out of Whitfurrows and Budgeford, the Player-heroes begin their journey towards Scary late in the evening. If they want to catch up with Otho, they must press on for at least a few hours in the dark. Before long, the sky clouds over, and a heavy rain begins to fall.
Slogging through the rain, even in a place as gentle as the Shire, is no comfortable task, and each of the Player-heroes will need to make a TRAVEL roll to stave off the weariness of a wet and cheerless evening, with failure resulting in gaining 2 Fatigue points.
With their slowed pace on the muddy road and a brief stop in an abandoned building to wait for the rain to cease, the conspirators arrive in Scary about one hour after dawn.
Scary is an unwelcoming village by Hobbit standards, nes- tled as it is on the south side of the Hills of Scary. It’s popu- lated by hard-working, no-nonsense Hobbits living in homes made of grey stone. Most folk are terse and a bit unkind, but if the Player-heroes ask around about other travellers from the south, they are told that the last visitor seen coming into town took a late bed at a building owned by some mining officials from Dwaling.
The building is a small, single-story house, with a couple of small bedrooms and a tiny common room containing three tables. When they get there, the conspirators find a Hobbit from Dwaling, a mining accountant by the name of Filibert Banks, busy scribbling in a large tome.
If questioned, Filibert seems to take for granted that the Hobbits are on some business errand, especially if he hears Lobelia’s family name (the Bracegirdles have a flourishing local business in construction), and thus proves to be quite cooperative.

ADVENTURES
Useful information can be extracted from Filibert with 3 successful Skill rolls, using any ability the conspira- tors and the Loremaster deem relevant.
The Player-heroes can play the conversation freely, but any Player-hero who fails a roll cannot make any more rolls to inquire further.
You wait for the sun to set. As you follow the rutted track that Filibert showed you, you get closer and closer to the dark that lies at the feet of the Hills of Scary. Here, the night air makes you shiver, as you carefully try not to stumble on the many broken rocks littering the path. In time, your eyes adjust and the outline of the hilltops appears, contrasting against the night sky. On the side of the hills, you make out the many tunnels gaping like bleak mouths leading into a seemingly impenetrable blackness.
It’s a scary prospect to go underground at this hour of the night, but you must discover what happened to Otho Sackville-Baggins before it’s too late.
Exploring the mines at night with only the light of a few lanterns is a daunting task. As a consequence, once the conspirators enter the dark beneath the hills, they must all pass a VALOUR roll to avoid losing 1 point of Hope.
A SOUGHT-AFTER SACKVILLE
To find where the foolish Hobbit has gone, the Player-heroes must explore the branching tunnels of the ‘treasure mine’.
The conspirators must choose one Player-hero as their guide in the tunnels — the guide can make a roll of EXPLORE once every hour.
To determine whether they find Otho, the Loremaster rolls a Success Die once for every successful EXPLORE Skill roll, add- ing 1 to the result for each Success icon rolled by the Player- hero. Then, the Loremaster checks the roll result against the following entries.

1.  FORGOTTEN SUPPLIES. You find a crude map of the mine left behind by some workers. Add 1 to the next roll.
2.  A NARROW SQUEEZE. Maybe you shouldn’t have had that extra morsel at breakfast! Squeezing through a particularly tight passage has led to scraped knees and torn knuckles. The guide loses 1 Endurance.
3.  AN ILL WIND. A chill wind seems to sweep up the passage from nowhere, extinguishing your lanterns. Relighting them takes some time, but the long dark and flickering lights are disturbing and will require
    a VALOUR roll from everyone before the lanterns are relit (lose 1 Hope on a failure).
4.  SORROWFUL SONGS BENEATH THE STONE. An indeci- pherable and ominous lament echoes across the stone and fades to nothing.
    ♦
    ♦
    ♦
    Upon a first success, Filibert reveals that he and Otho had a long ‘business’ conversation while in their cups. Filibert told his roommate for the night that based on his accounting, there was a tunnel in the quarry that proved to be very fruitful, but that no one, not even Dwarves, had been able to penetrate it deeply, for the rock was too hard.
    On a second success, Filibert regales the Player-heroes with ghoulish tales about ‘the lost miner’ haunting that specific tunnel, stories of passages abandoned after flooding, and rumours of ghostly voices echoing in the empty chambers.
    A third and final success has Filibert relating how Otho, inebriated with Filibert’s story of an untapped
    ‘treasure mine’, started blathering about how soon everyone in the Shire was going to be speaking to him with proper respect, while he kept patting the large sack he brought with him.
    The final revelation from Filibert about Otho is that he stum- bled off more than a bit tipsy a few hours before dawn, after having asked Filibert for directions to reach ‘his treasure mine’. He left with a lantern, a tinderbox, a coil of rope, and his large sack.
    part two: quest in the quarry
    Having been mined by Hobbits since the days of Marcho and Blanco, the Hills of Scary are riddled with holes, tunnels, and all sorts of excavations. During the day, the area is bustling, with workers going in and out of their mines, or tending to the stone pulled from the quarries. Almost as grumpy as busy Dwarves, they have little news to offer to nosy strangers — no one seems to have seen Otho entering or leaving.
    If the Player-heroes try to reach the ‘treasure mine’ openly, possibly following directions provided by Filibert, they soon discover that it’s impossible to reach — as soon as they get near, they are stopped by mining officials and sent back to the village. After a brief investigation, it should be clear to the Player-heroes that slipping in during the day is impossible. Coming back after sunset seems to be the only way.

    MAD AS AN ORC
    A flickering flame casts jagged shadows at the end of a pas- sage that ends in a pile of tumbled rocks. The Player-heroes hear a mad cry echoing against the rock and into the dark- ness. As they round the corner, they see a lantern set upon a stone, casting long shadows over a terrible sight: a terrified Hobbit stands in front of a massive pile of fireworks piled up at the blocked end of a tunnel, feebly brandishing a shovel at what appears to be a grey Orc. Otho is screaming madly at the creature: “It’s my treasure, ye monster! Mine! Mine! I’ll blow it to rubble before I let ye have it!”
    On your arrival, the Hobbit turns and screeches in renewed fright. He stiffens and stammers, failing to hide his abject panic. If the players don’t act quickly, Otho will likely bury them all in the mine.
    The Orc is a very decrepit Orc veteran, who was lost long ago, and took refuge deep in the mines and in the natural caves under the Hills of Scary. Since then, he has been hiding, trying to drive the Hobbits from his lair whenever they would come too close to discovering his presence. The players will have to take up arms to stop him from attacking Otho, an act that will most likely end in a quite spectacular explosion and the destruction of the mine.
    At the arrival of the Player-heroes, the Orc turns his atten- tion to the newly arrived threat and attacks. He will fight until Wounded or reduced to half or less of his Endurance before fleeing into the dark passages of the mine.

    If Otho is saved, the Player-heroes receive little thanks from the wayward Hobbit. Despite having his life spared by their timely arrival, Otho fully intends to stake his claim on this part of the mine. So, he proposes the following deal: if the conspirators agree to serve as witnesses to the signing of con- tracts giving Otho exclusive mining rights to the tunnel (seven signatures in red ink, all right and proper), he will give them half of the Wizard’s excellent fireworks. If they agree, Otho informs them that he’ll pass the contracts on for Lobelia to
    sign, and they can take half the fireworks with them to Bag End — he’ll personally repay the Bracegirdles for the fire-
    works out of his own pocket.
    As for the Orc veteran, the Player-heroes can inform
    the mining officials of his presence. They will then inves- tigate the mine and eventually discover a deep passage that was previously undiscovered, littered with bones of small animals and remnants of an encampment, but
    no signs of Orcs...
    Upon their return to Bag End, Bilbo stores the
    remaining fireworks in one of his cellars, under lock and key.

    ADVENTURES
    involuntary postmen
    ... the offices of Postmaster and First Shirriff were attached to the mayoralty, so that he managed both the Messenger Service and the Watch.
    No trouble goes unnoticed in the Shire, and the Bounders have finally decided to take action against the conspirators and their ongoing mischief. By order of the Shirriffs, Bilbo Baggins’ Hobbit collaborators have been sentenced to clean- ing the cold storage and wine cellar underneath the Town Hole at Michel Delving! But the sympathies of an overworked member of the Quick Post and the promise to deliver a letter clear across the Shire to Brandy Hall could earn them early release, and a new adventure to boot!
    This adventure can be played at any time after the events of A Conspiracy Most Cracked, immediately pre- ceding To Soothe a Savage Beast. If played in sequence, it is now late summer, in the year S.R. 1360.
    part one: captive conspirators
    This adventure opens with the Player-heroes (not including Bilbo or Balin) having already been rounded up by several local Bounders after news of their troublesome misadven- tures have turned the Shire into a buzz of concern and gos- sip. As time passed while they were wandering about, several Hobbits for whom they’ve caused trouble have reported on their misdeeds. This can include custodian Malva Slowfoot, Bounder Ada Burrows, Primrose and Bruno Bracegirdle, and any other busybodies they have disturbed during their adventures. Their troublesome ways have finally caught up with them!
    This is intolerable! You always wanted to visit the Town Hole in Michel Delving, but not like this. It appears the conspira- tors have finally met one trouble they could not escape. After being confronted by a group of Bounders and charged with claims of disturbing the peace and on-going rowdiness, the lot of you have been detained in the storage tunnels beneath the Town Hole until Mayor Pott can decide what to do with you.
    While there are worse things than being locked in a stor- age cellar beneath the Town Hole, it is an uncomfortable place. A heavy wooden door, barred from the other side, blocks you from freedom, and other than the occasional Bounder coming by, no one has so much as brought you a seed cake to munch on for hours! When Bilbo finds out about this, they will regret their actions... he will find out, right?
    OUT OF THE CELLAR
    The incarcerated conspirators take a few moments to investi- gate the storage cellar: they see a number of sealed beer bar- rels and several cuts of salted meat, inedible without prepa- ration, and several large loaves of crusty bread and wheels of hard cheese (the Loremaster should note if any Player-heroes take some of the foodstuffs as it may become relevant later in the adventure).
    The ground here is packed dirt, and the walls are the same, save for a few support beams. A single, weak lantern is set on one of the barrels for light (using it to start a fire in the middle of Michel Delving is probably not the best idea). Their usual possessions and any weapons have naturally been taken from them by the Bounders, and have been stored in

        INVOLUNTARY POSTMEN

    Odo Proudfoot
    If he receives a positive response, he and Mayor Pott step within the chamber. He leaves the door open, allowing the characters to see their gear stacked up neatly against the wall. Odo explains that the Quick Post is short-handed and he has a letter that needs delivering to Bamfurlong, in the Marish.
    He has no one to send and got the impression from the tall, hooded figure that accosted him outside town with the letter that the message was urgent. Furthermore, there’s a lot of traffic on the main road – Dwarves mostly, heading west or east as the case may be, trying to get home before the year grows too long.
    The Mayor speaks up, saying that the conspirators owe community service for their transgressions and that they have been volunteered to deliver the letter, ‘unless you’d rather stay here.’
    If they accept, then Odo hands them the sealed letter, instructing them to take it to Bamfurlong, staying off the East Road and taking the Stock Road instead, thus cutting across the Green Hills and going through the Woody End.
    Before he lets them go, Odo adds that he promised the hooded figure that the letter would stay sealed — only to be opened by Farmer Maggot, to whom it is addressed.
    LEAVING MICHEL DELVING
    Once the characters gather up the gear, Mayor Pott leads them back upstairs and out through the Mathom-house. Play- er-heroes who mention that they are scouting for anything of use notice that a series of strange, two-wheeled contraptions made of wood and metal have been lined up against the wall of the Mathom-house — certainly some newly-delivered acqui- sitions of the museum. Malva Slowfoot has labeled them with a tag, identifying each one as a ‘velocipede’.
    Whether they’re a strange creation by some eccentric Shire craftsman or a Dwarven smith, these velocipedes look like vehicles that can be ridden at some speed! Mayor Pott harrumphs if the player-heroes ask to use the velocipedes; he reminds them that they are doing community service and he expects them to suffer, at least a little bit.
    If the Player-heroes ‘borrow’ the velocipedes to leave Michel Delving in a hurry, they must pass a roll of ATHLETICS to master the strange contraptions without anyone noticing their clumsy attempt. A failure indi- cates that some local takes notice of the Player-heroes’ suspicious activities, and the theft of the velocipedes is added to the conspirators list of misdeeds!
    If the Player-heroes leave Michel Delving riding the veloci- pedes, whenever they must make a roll of TRAVEL they gain (1d).
    the corridor outside the cellar door (the gear can be easily retrieved if they find a way to get out).
    The conspirators remain here without news from out- side long enough to make them despair about their fate. Just when they are getting too restless, a soft knock is heard at the door and a reluctant voice hisses out. Awkwardly, the voice introduces itself as Odo Proudfoot. They recognize the name as belonging to someone working for the Quick Post in Michel Delving. Odo asks if he can come in, which will likely seem strange to the company, seeing as the door han- dle is on his side.
    THE LETTER TO BAMFURLONG
    Hobbits have a great respect for propriety and privacy, and that includes matters of the Quick Post. The letter is sealed by wax, but has no sym- bol set into the seal. Player-heroes would know that opening the letter would be a most improper invasion of privacy, and the misdeed would cost them 1 point of Hope

    ADVENTURES
    part two: round and round
    Having escaped Michel Delving, the Player-heroes now begin their journey east towards the Marish and Bamfurlong. Nor- mally, such a trip should take about four or five days to com- plete, and require the rules for Hobbit Walks described on page 10 of The Shire. But while the Shire is a peaceful land free of many of the troubles that plague other regions, travelling across its length is not without its own challenges.
    From your first hours on the road, you realise that what Odo told you seems right — more Bounders than usual are out making their rounds. So, you have no other choice than to stay off the roads. This means riding along well-trodden country paths and tracks, heading east towards Whitwell, and Tookland beyond.
    But what could be little more than an extended walking party soon proves troublesome... You have set out on your post- man duties across the Shire without provisions, save for a few bits of old and stale bread and cheese from beneath the Town Hole of Michel Delving, and this is a problem of capital import!
    The first day of travel brings the Player-heroes to the outskirts of Tookbank — they may consider the possibility of sneaking into town and purloining something to eat — but that is a risky business. Alternatively, they can search for wild fruits and berries growing in the open land, or even attempt to
    ‘borrow’ carrots or other choice vegetables from one of the many farms of Tookland. Hunting small game is right out, given that the tiny creatures found in the region are not likely to make more than a mouthful even if they could be snared.
    On their second day of travel, dawn comes bright and clear, with all indications that it will be a perfectly fine day for walking. However, as midday draws near, the sky turns grey, and heavy clouds roll in. By the time lunch has passed, a heavy rainstorm has released its fury, and the Player-heroes find themselves trudging through muddy terrain as they head towards the Green Hill Country.
    Each Player-hero gains 2 additional points of Fatigue as the weight of hard travel begins to press down upon them, body and soul (a roll of TRAVEL can reduce the amount of points gained, as usual).
    The rain subsides at sunset, and soon the night sky clears. Plodding in the dark on hilly terrain is not a wise idea, and while the Player-heroes might press on into the Woody End that evening, it is probably best that they bed down for the night. Just as they are about to sleep for the evening, a pair of red squirrels wander curiously into their camp, and try to steal some food from the travellers. If shooed away rudely,
    they flee into the woods, but if treated kindly or even offered a bit of food by the Hobbits, they take a few bites off whatever they are offered, chitter excitedly, and flee into the woods.
    As the Player-heroes enter the Woody End itself on their third day of travelling, the Loremaster must consider how the Player-heroes interacted with the beasts they have encoun- tered in their adventures so far. This includes Firework the dog from A Conspiracy Most Cracked, Gertrude the mule and the owl in Waymeet, and the curious squirrel couple encoun- tered the previous evening. Word of their actions has spread among these creatures across the Shire, and now their rep- utation precedes them.
    If in the majority of cases the animals were treated kindly and shown compassion, then the Player-heroes find their journey in the forest light and easy, discover- ing convenient berry bushes along the road, allowing them to eat, and finding the finch songs reaching into their heart restoring 1 point of Hope to each of them.
    FINDING FOOD TO GO
    The Loremaster can resolve any foraging action attempted by the Player-heroes as follows (each player has one Skill roll attempt each day of travel): ♦ Player-heroes attempting to sneak into a vil-
    lage to steal food must make a STEALTH roll,
    but they lose 1 Hope when they do so!
    ♦ Those searching the wilderness for wild fruit
    can make an EXPLORE roll.
    ♦ Anyone looking for a vegetable field to pluck a
    cabbage or two from can make a SCAN roll, but they lose (1d) as they must cover large areas.
    Success means they have found enough food for themselves for one day. Each Success icon yields enough food to feed themselves for an additional day — or to feed themselves and another Hobbit.
    Any Player-hero who goes to bed each day with an empty belly gains 1 point of Fatigue, in addition to whatever is gained for travelling, and must make a WISDOM roll to avoid losing 1 Hope as they suf- fer the incomprehensible fate of going to bed with no supper.
    22
    sam hiew (Order #40059664)

        If the animals were treated poorly, the forest is oppres- sive: the sounds of the beasts and birds have a dour and unwelcome note to them, and each day of travel in the Woody End requires a VALOUR roll to avoid losing 1 Hope.

    part three: enchantment in the woody end
    As the Player-heroes reach the eastern edge of the Woody End and they hear the babbling waters of the Stock-brook, a new enchantment reveals itself.
    The stars burn bright and free tonight, in spite of your wea- riness and the hunger you have faced along your journey. A lightness enters your heart as you rest upon the banks of
    the Stock-brook. Then, as if the starlight were given form and voice, you see a being from legend step out of the soft embrace of night to shine upon you. A voice like music says
    “Elen síla lúmenn’ omentielvo.”
    As if given form by that song, you see an Elf, clad in blue
    raiment with hair as fair as gold. He smiles at you and your companions, “Whether it be a merry chance or some greater will that has brought us together, I am glad for it. I am Gal- dor of the Havens, and I have long been curious about the mischievous Hobbits that have been going about causing all manner of stories to be spun by birds and beasts across the Shire. Why, I spoke only a few days ago to Badger-brock of the Withywindle, and he told me of your company, each by name, as he had heard it from a finch, who heard it from a fox. I suspect that by now, even Iarwain in the Old Forest has heard of your merry mishaps. But I am forgetting myself, adopting rustic ways for these rustic realms. May I trade some simple Elvish travelling fare in exchange for sharing your Company and your camp this evening?”
    If the Player-heroes accept Galdor’s Company, he does indeed provide them with loaves of fair white bread and a light, golden beverage.
    The Elvish provisions restore both heart and spirit, restoring each Player-hero to their full Endurance, cancelling all accumulated Fatigue, and restoring 1 point of Hope each, as they fill bellies and lift spirits.
    Galdor is a kind but curious guest, and subtly questions the Player-heroes. This attempt goes unnoticed unless a Player- hero succeeds in an INSIGHT roll. If they fail, he draws the truth of their adventures from them — but he offers laugh- ter, a light heart, and a fair song in return for this informa- tion. He tells them to sleep peacefully tonight, for they have nothing to fear.
    When the Hobbits wake in the morning, they find fresh fruit and nuts to serve as breakfast, and Galdor is already awake. He tells them that he has an errand to attend to, and must now depart. He offers them blessings and cautions regarding further adventures. Moments later, he vanishes into the forest of the Woody End.

    ADVENTURES
    Farmer Maggot
    epilogue
    Later that same day, the conspirators finally cross the Stock- brook at a spot where it meanders shallowly and can be forded. After having asked some fishermen for directions, the Player-heroes arrive that afternoon at Bamfurlong in the Marish.
    Bamfurlong is a long brick farmhouse with a thatched roof, surrounded by great fields of vegetables in their full
    bloom of the season which run up to a high wall with a gate that marks the entrance upon the lane. It is located approx- imately halfway between Stock and Rushey.
    As the Player-heroes approach, they see a young but broad Hobbit in his tweens working the fields, and stop- ping to watch them closely as he leans upon a shovel. Upon spotting the Player-heroes, he shoulders the shovel, saun- ters towards them, and tersely asks them their business. He regards them cautiously, one by one. He offers them noth- ing but a stern look and his name, Farmer Maggot, dismiss- ing them out of hand unless they mention that they carry a letter for him. He asks them to produce the letter, which he snatches from them and tears open on the spot. After reading a few lines, he lets out a deep laugh, and seems to relax into an amiable Hobbit.
    “I was told you were coming, but I wasn’t sure I would have actually seen you in the flesh. It’s quite a long road from Michel Delving! Please, please, follow me. You must be hun- gry, and thirsty, and quite weary by the look of you.”
    Farmer Maggot invites the conspirators to follow him to his home, where he leads them into his kitchen. There, they see a fine table has been laid, and none other than Bilbo Baggins himself sits at it, eating a bright-coloured apple!
    Bilbo smiles impishly at Maggot, and winks at the Player- heroes.
    “Oh, I see you got my letter, good Mister Maggot! Now that we’re all here, we’ll get to the business at hand!”

        TO SOOTHE A SAVAGE BEAST

    to soothe a savage beast
    There was victory and defeat; and towers fell, fortresses were burned, and flames went up into the sky.
    One final favour, and Bilbo will leave his beloved conspirators in peace. He joins them for a visit with young Farmer Maggot, freshly of Bamfurlong, as he is a shrewd farmer with much insight into the misunderstood ways of Bucklanders. But Mag- got has his own troubles with a terrible beast from over the High Hay, and before long, the conspirators find themselves in the heart of the Old Forest after dark and face to face with the true wonder and danger that awaits when simple Hobbits move beyond the borders of the Shire.
    This adventure should be played as the last one taken from this volume. If played in sequence, summer is now waning, in the year S.R. 1360.
    Having arrived before the others at Bamfurlong, Bilbo returns as a playable Player-hero available to the play- ers. If they need to swap out an existing character it is recommended that Lobelia be the one to leave the con- spirators — clearly having had more than enough of this nonsense, and quite infuriated to have anything to do with Bucklanders and any business beyond the Shire proper, she returns to her mother’s home in the Yale.
    part one: buckland bound
    The adventure opens with the Player-heroes awakening once again in comfortable beds inside the farmhouse of Bamfur- long to the scent of eggs and mushrooms cooking for a late breakfast. The last few days have been a welcome comfort after their long journey across the Shire.
    The Loremaster should restore each character to their full Endurance, as they have had a few days to rest.
    Bilbo and Maggot both dismiss any ‘business talk’ until after the table has been cleared, but soon after the crockery has been cleaned and pipes have been lit, Maggot’s demeanour turns grim.
    The Loremaster can read or paraphrase the following text.
    Sitting upon a long bench under the eaves of Bamfurlong, Farmer Maggot takes a long draw from his pipe and gazes out to a small ruined building on the far side of his wide
    farmlands. “Chickens,” he says suddenly as he blows out a long line of blue-grey smoke. “It is because of my chickens that I sent my letter, Master Baggins.”
    Any hint of jest fades away as he leans in to you and your friends. “And to be honest, I’m glad you have not come alone. When I saw that thing that night, blood in its teeth and fire in its eyes, I knew it was something beyond the ken of myself or any other folk in the Eastfarthing. It was a beast, I tell you, and not some hungry wolf that came up from Dunland starving. This was a black thing, as if its fur had been burnt like kindling, with nothing natural about it, and it set chills down my spine — no easy task, mind you. But when I heard it growl at me, we locked eyes and I saw naught but a lust for death in its gaze. It meant to kill more than my chickens in their coop that night. I grabbed a lantern in one hand you see, and my chopping axe. If it was going to take me, I wasn’t going down without a fight. Before I knew what happened, it was on me, crossing the field in a bound and pinning me to the soil, snarling and slavering.”
    sam hiew (Order #40059664)

    ADVENTURES
    Maggot’s eyes glaze over in memory and you see him tremble at the recollection. “In a fit, I swung my lantern up and it shattered, pouring oil upon its muzzle. It yelped and screamed as the fire blazed, and it fled into the dark. The last things I saw before it disappeared towards the Brandy- wine were those horrible, fiery eyes.”
    He sets his pipe on the bench beside him. “It's still out there. I swear I’ve seen it beyond the edges of Bamfurlong on more than one night since then, those eyes burning into me from the dark. And if the stirrings from Buckland are any hint, it is causing no end of trouble there too. Master Bilbo, sir, I was hoping that you and your friends here might help me and the Buckland folk put a stop to that foul thing’s hunting before it gets a taste for something more than chickens.”
    Maggot has little to offer in reward for their aid, but will give the conspirators a bed at Bamfurlong should ever they need it in days to come, and send them off with a basket of his mush- rooms, which can serve as fine provender as they search for the ‘Burnt Beast’, as he calls it, with a promise of more any time they wish after the matter is settled.
    Finally, Maggot adds that he only ever saw the beast at night, and he believes it has somehow crossed over to Buckland and is troubling the Brandybucks now, based on news he’s heard from Bucklebury. They might want to begin their search for the creature by crossing the Brandywine at Bucklebury Ferry, and should probably depart this same evening.
    UP THE CAUSEWAY TO BUCKLEBURY FERRY
    The trip up the Causeway to reach Bucklebury Ferry is an easy one, but the evening air feels strangely still. No Hobbits are seen relaxing out of doors on their farms in the Marish, and no children are found catching fireflies.
    One hour later, about halfway to the Ferry, the Player- heroes feel a growing sense of dread creeping over them, as if a rabbit were sensing a nearby predator. It’s a disheartening feeling, seeping into their very bones.
    As they continue on, any Player-hero who states that they are looking around for a source of the dread can attempt an AWARENESS roll. Failure means they are unable to spot something specific that is causing their unease, but those who are successful see a pair of red eyes here and there. Once behind a fence, another time obscured by a row of hedges, and again slipping away behind a small house.
    Upon finally reaching the winding road that turns east off the Causeway, they begin walking down the path towards Bucklebury Ferry. Indeed, they can see it for themselves in the distance, illuminated by starlight reflected in the Brandy- wine River.
    The Loremaster can read or paraphrase the following text.
    At last this uneasy night stroll reaches its destination. You see as you turn off the Causeway, further down the lane, the square floating platform that is the Bucklebury Ferry. With no ferryman tending it at night, you will have to cross on your own, but the water is calm, and the stars are bright. A sigh of released tension is prematurely interrupted when you see a pair of red eyes come up from the ditch along the western side of the Causeway.

        TO SOOTHE A SAVAGE BEAST

    It may have once been a dog or wolf, but its fur is burnt and stiff, the colour of cold ashes. Fiery eyes gleam in the night as it prowls towards you, never flinching. Its predatory confidence grows with each step. Never once does it make a sound, not even its footfalls. Nearly as tall as a Hobbit at the shoulder, its silent snarl reveals white fangs stained pink, as it breaks into a charge towards you!
    This is a true battle. The Player-heroes have little time to pre- pare for it, and indeed it might be wiser for them to consider the option of escaping, for example using the Ferry.
    Racing down the road and leaping onto the ferry requires an ATHLETICS roll, and the choice of whether to stand and fight or flee must be made quickly.
    The Loremaster should press the players, and force them to make their choice swiftly. Those who fail their roll to flee fall behind and become a prime target for the terrible black beast.
    Player-heroes who muster their courage and decide to stand and fight in hopes of delaying the creature or protecting their friends can manage one Opening Volley before the beast is upon them. If the creature takes 10 or more points of damage, it turns and flees, leaping over the far side of the Causeway and disap- pearing into the night.
    Once the characters have begun their crossing, keen eyes gazing back upon the western bank of the Brandywine River and succeeding in an AWARENESS roll to notice a pair of red eyes watching them from the darkness, before the beast darts to the north along the river bank.
    part two: buckland troubles
    After crossing the Brandywine, the Player-heroes enter Buck- land and head towards Brandy Hall in the late hours of the night. Right after leaving the ferry, they are approached by a Bucklander watchman carrying a lantern, with his other hand resting on the pommel of a sheathed short sword. He is terse with the Player-heroes, telling them that they shouldn’t be using the ferry at night, and that any strangers are to be escorted to Brandy Hall for their own safety. He offers to guide them the rest of the way. If they refuse, he insists, say- ing it’s the Master of Buckland’s orders.
    While walking to Brandy Hall, any Player-heroes that ask the guard what is causing the extra security mea- sures must make a COURTESY roll to get him to open up — though no roll is necessary if Rory or Primula Brandybuck are among the Player-heroes present. If successful, he introduces himself as Braddoc, and reveals that there are rumours of a savage creature threatening the locals. If they roll one or more icons, he tells them some kind of wild dog matching the description of the beast was seen prowling around Crickhollow, terrorizing the area.
    Upon arriving at Brandy Hall, the Player-heroes are given a chance to rest and recount their troubles. The Master of Buckland himself, Gorbadoc Brandybuck, comes to hear their tale, for it concerns him greatly, as Rory and Primula are his children and Drogo is to be his son by marriage.
    Loremasters can read or paraphrase the following text to open the scene.
    Braddoc the watchman leads you up the road and to the main entrance of the grand Hobbit-hole that is Brandy Hall. Much to your surprise, given the time of night, you see none other than the Master of Buckland, Gorbadoc Brandybuck himself, pacing on the front walk. Pipe clenched in his teeth and leaning on a heavy wooden cudgel, he looks up at the light of Braddoc’s lantern and smiles. “Glad to see you, my lads and lasses.”
    Trouble is visible on Gorbadoc’s face, but he waves it away after offering Braddoc a quick thank you and asking the group if they’d like to come in for some late-night vittles. Once they’ve all sat down at the table, Gorbadoc assures everyone that they’ll have proper lodging for the night. It’s only then that he brings up the subject of the creature, ask- ing anyone injured in their previous encounter with the beast where they got their wounds. He tells them that the

    ADVENTURES
    Gorbadoc Brandybuck
    beast has been prowling about Buckland as well, and it trou- bles him to hear it's somehow crossed the Brandywine — such a thing makes no sense to him, as the creature was only spotted last night, and he finds it hard to believe that the beast swam the length of the Brandywine and then back again to trouble Farmer Maggot.
    The beast, Gorbadoc tells them, has been taking livestock from Newbury, and just last night Rollo Boffin sounded the alarm, claiming he saw the beast on the edge of his property at Crickhollow. He fears it's only a matter of time before the creature hurts someone.
    Before going to bed, Gorbadoc adds that even as Master of Buckland, he’s got no right to tell others how to live, but if they’re going to stick their nose into this matter they’d best be careful.
    CRISIS AT CRICKHOLLOW
    An hour before dawn Saradas Brandybuck (brother of Rory and Primula) wakes the Player-heroes, and tells them that there’s been another attack. Rollo Boffin came running from Crickhollow all the way to Brandy Hall, screaming that he’d seen the beast again, and that this time the thing had been
    snarling at his very window. Saradas tells the Player-heroes that Gorbadoc is asleep, and he didn’t want to wake the old Master, so he came and got them instead.
    Saradas leads them to a parlour in Brandy Hall where the newly arrived Rollo is sitting with shaking hands, nurs- ing a cup of tea. Fearfully, and with stumbling words, Rollo describes the beast he saw, with fur burnt black and red fiery eyes, stalking back and forth near the edge of his property. He panicked and fled, running as fast as he could until he reached Brandy Hall. He begs the conspirators to help him.
    When Rollo’s story ends, the players turn to see Gorbadoc who has been standing in the doorway listening quietly. With a reluctant look upon his face, he nods, saying Rollo is right. He needs to keep the watchmen here and it's only proper that the Player-heroes investigate since they’ve encountered the creature before. Once all is agreed upon, if Drogo is in the Company, then Gorbadoc puts a hand on his shoulder and tells him “Thank you, son. For what you’re doing for my family and my daughter. You and your family will always have a room at Brandy Hall.”
    The characters arrive at Crickhollow after a brief early morning walk from Brandy Hall a few miles away, but find no damage to the house itself. Anyone who searches the prop- erty discovers signs of disturbance — trampled flower beds, bark ripped from trees as if by animal claws, the carcasses of a few dead rabbits, and most disturbing of all, great gouges in the rear door of Rollo Boffin’s house.
    Anyone who makes a SCAN roll spots a small trail leading towards the eastern end of the property that appears to dip and run to the very High Hay itself. Once they get near it, the Player-heroes get the uncanny sense that they are being watched.
    It is then that the beast strikes again! Leaping from a long shadow cast by the rising sun against the High Hay, the horrid creature lunges at the nearest Player-hero! But the creature is not moving in for the kill — after a single successful attack or after being hit, the beast runs down the narrow path to the end of the property and disappears.
    The path from Crickhollow to the High Hay dips very low as it goes on for some time, eventually coming to a brick lined gap in the Hedge where it ends in a set of thick iron bars. Though once forming a sturdy barrier, the gate appears to have been bent and twisted by some creature from the Old Forest trying to get in.
    Careful examination of the gate via a HUNTING or SCAN roll reveals a few tufts of black fur caught in a hinge. It is clear

    that the black beast came this way, from somewhere inside the Old Forest. If they do not dare to take the hunt for the terrible creature into such a gloomy and dangerous place, it will only continue to plague the people of the Eastfarthing for countless nights to come.
    part three: the old forest
    The Player-heroes have now truly passed beyond the safety of the Shire. After slipping through the tiny iron gate beneath the High Hay and into the Old Forest proper, they catch their first full look at this strange and legendary wood.
    The Old Forest. Countless tales are told, from Buckland to the White Downs, about the strange affairs of this untamed wild. To your surprise, the forest itself does not immediately leap out and attack you as soon as you step past the bent iron gate and fully into the woods.
    Instead, a thin collection of trees, bent and gnarled, sur- rounds you, just out of reach, their full branches not quite touching you. A wide path, barely visible from the gate, runs east and slightly to the north, over a low rise where you see a break in the trees. After a brief walk through moss-covered trees growing in countless shapes and sizes, you come to a wide, bare space where no trees grow. It forms a wide circle, and the sun reaches down, unobscured by the thick canopy of reaching branches and wide leaves.
    Beyond this, the Old Forest grows thick and free. Trees, gnarled and twisted, with great roots sticking up from the ground and dipping back down again, grow freely, and there is little in the way of a path as the ground continues a slow ascent, and the sense that you are an unwanted visitor and are being watched grows in your mind. In this wild and twisted place, it is clear that the Burnt Beast will have the advantage, and your hunt will be most difficult.
    Player-heroes asking the Loremaster what they know about tales of the Old Forest may make a LORE roll. With a success, they learn that rumour has it that the forest is alive and actively dislikes visitors, with some believing that the trees themselves actually move to obstruct travellers with twisting roots and tangling branches. Long ago some Hobbits actually drove the Old Forest back when the wood itself moved and tried to attack the hedge. Bucklanders travelled beyond the High Hay and drove it away with fire. One or more icons include knowledge that the Old Forest is said to be the home of a wandering spirit that speaks to trees and bends the beasts that live in it to his will.
    THE HUNT FOR THE BURNT BEAST
    The Loremaster should ask the players which one (and only one) of the Player-heroes will act as the scout for the group. The scout is in charge of trying to maintain orien- tation and prevent them from getting lost in the strange and shifting Old Forest. All Player-heroes not serving as the scout are instead searching for signs of the beast's passage as hunters. This could include tufts of fur, blood, or paw prints. There is no limit to the number of Player-heroes attempting to track the beast, though no character can be both scout and hunter.
    The scout must make a single ExPLORE roll, while the hunters must accumulate 3 successful HUNTING rolls. If the ExPLORE roll fails, the HUNTING rolls lose (1d); if it succeeds with one or more icons, they gain (1d) instead.
    On any failed HUNTING roll, the Loremaster must roll a Feat Die to determine what type of strange encoun- ter occurs, using the table found on page 49 of The Shire. Likewise, for every couple of hours of searching, if the Player-heroes have not rolled 3 successes, the Loremaster rolls on the table again.
    Once the required HUNTING successes have been reached, the Company finds the Burnt Beast, which prowls near the banks of the Withywindle, prepared to ambush the charac- ters. Go to Part Four.
    ANGERING THE OLD FOREST
    Player-heroes who brandish axes or speak ill of the forest may find the trees treat them with even more contempt and malice than before. Insults and threats spoken aloud in the Old Forest can make this journey even more dangerous, and the Loremaster should consider increasing the num- ber of HUNTING rolls required by 1 if they speak so foolishly.

    ADVENTURES
    part four: burning battle
    The Player-heroes have finally cornered the Burnt Beast, and can put an end to the troubles it is bringing to the Eastfarthing!
    The thick woodland opens ever so slightly to reveal a great thorn thicket that is impossibly large and twisted. From under the strangling vines, you see a familiar pair of burning eyes, as the Burnt Beast slithers forth from the darkness. An instant later, a chill runs down your spine, as a second pair of eyes appears in the darkness only a moment before another of these horrid creatures comes forth, intent on devouring you and your friends. It is not one of these shadowed predators prowling the Old Forest, but a fierce mated pair that has been cornered and driven to defend the bramble-ridden thorn hedge they’ve taken as home. They leap forward, prepared to finish you and your friends off now that there are no people of the Shire to hear your screams.
    The Burnt Beasts, now revealed to be a pair and not a singu- lar creature, are cornered and threatened, fighting fiercely. More dangerous than anything the conspirators have faced so far, this seems a true life-or-death situation — the Burnt Beasts have drawn the Player-heroes out of the Shire and into their territory.
    The Loremaster should refer to the stats presented on page 27 for both Burnt Beasts.
    ANCIENT SONGS AND NEW FRIENDS
    Fortunately, all the commotion going on in the Old Forest has not gone unnoticed. Depending on how the Player-heroes have acted through the course of their adventures, aid may soon arrive to help them in this dire time.
    After a number of rounds of battle, Tom Bombadil arrives and chases away the beasts. The number of rounds is equal to 6, minus 1 for each instance that the Player-heroes have shown kindness to the animal inhabitants of the Shire (including, but not limited to, the owl at Waymeet, Firework the dog, the Squirrels of Woody End, etc.).
    If the Player-heroes defeat the Burnt Beasts before Tom’s arrival, this changes little, and the situation still plays out narratively as before. They simply flee into the forest and Tom arrives moments later.
    Breaking through your fear and weariness, you hear a strange voice rise, and the black beasts draw back from you, looking towards the sound. Dancing as though at a spring festival, you see a wanderer merrily skipping about in yellow boots. Taller than a Hobbit, though not as tall as a Man, his face sports a careful smile, and he sweeps off his great floppy hat with a bow to you, and then again to the two beasts! Rising again, replacing his hat and straightening his blue jacket, he speaks in a kind of sing-song rhyme.
    “Hey ho, silly ho, tramp across the forest
    Little creatures under foot, black dogs are the sorest Go now, silly dogs, cast away your ire
    Hobbits only hope to help,
    Come now, little dogs, no need to be so dire”
    Tom prances over to the Player-heroes, and the Burnt Beasts break off their attack and flee from his presence. He pays them little heed for his part, much more interested in the Player-heroes. Instead, he sings his brief rhyme and then merrily bids the Hobbits to follow him to his house, where they can find refreshment and recover. (The Lore- master can read more about Tom Bombadil on page 51 of
    The Shire).
    While the Player-heroes rest for the evening in the House
    of Bombadil, Tom reveals what he knows about the true nature of the Burnt Beasts: They were once hounds owned by a lord of Men, residing long ago in a tower of stone which rose among the hills which are now known as the Barrow- downs, beyond the Old Forest. In a time of terrible war, the lord perished among the flames, and his faithful hounds with him. When evil spirits descended upon the Barrow-downs, many years later, the hounds returned as dark reflections of what they once were.
    They are now terrible creatures, but yet, they are not entirely evil, says Tom — something of their faithful nature remains, and they seldom attempt to kill. But their malice is growing year after year, as if the ill-will of the Old Forest itself is slowly taking over. Can it be that something can be done to remind them of what it means to be steadfast and true? Can they be given peace? Perhaps, Tom asks, if the Player-heroes are willing to help them find their way back to being fine companion hounds, they could be released from their wretched state.
    If the Player-heroes agree, Tom tells them that the Burnt Beasts must be again given proper names, and if the Player- heroes will give them such names, the true and loyal nature

        TO SOOTHE A SAVAGE BEAST

    of their hearts can perhaps be restored. When asked why Tom couldn’t name them himself, he says:
    “Tom doesn’t fear the hounds, and the hounds leave Tom be, my merries! Listen to Old Tom’s songs and sing them back, recalling hearth and home. Gentle voices and kind souls will cast away the doom.”
    Tom teaches them several of his strange songs, as if they were simple children’s rhymes, then merrily bids the characters get a good night’s rest in his home. Come dawn, they can set out with a song in their hearts to restore the Burnt Beasts.
    RETURN TO THE LAIR
    At dawn, the Player-heroes awake to find Tom has gone out to collect river lilies for his wife. Goldberry tells the Player-heroes that the Burnt Beasts are still prowling around their lair in the nearby thorny thicket. Upon returning to the thicket, the Player-heroes spot the mated pair of creatures at once. They move to attack as soon as the conspirators arrive.
    Though the Player-heroes can kill the Burnt Beasts with their weapons, their death is not permanent. They will rise again, and return to plague the Shire, unless they are slain using blades of Westernesse or similar magical weapons. Instead, some among the Player-heroes must hold off the savage beasts while others sing the songs they learned from Bombadil.
    This requires the conspirators to pass 3 SONG rolls. Any number of Player-heroes not engaged with the Burnt Beasts can sing.
    If successful, the Burnt Beasts become light of heart, as all darkness and sorrow is washed away from their spirit. At that point, the Player-heroes can give them a name. Once the power of Tom’s song and their new names have taken hold, the ashen features of the Burnt Beasts fade away, and their eyes brighten from fiery red to a gentle colour. The hounds, joyful, cheerful creatures once more, run away to play on the paths of the Old Forest, running beyond the edge of the Player-heroes’ sight.
    epilogue
    Having released the hounds from their curse, the Player- heroes make their way through the Old Forest back towards the Shire, and oddly enough, the woods do not seem to impede their travel. Once back in Buckland, the Player-heroes are given a warm welcome by Gorbadoc, and another night of fine eating and resting before crossing the Brandywine back into the Marish.
    The Loremaster can read or paraphrase the following text.
    You arrive at Maggot’s house just in time for dinner, and find the farmer intent on rebuilding his chicken coop. As you greet Maggot, to your surprise and amazement the once- cursed dogs appear out of nowhere and run to Maggot, bark- ing merrily. At first, the farmer is a bit fearful, but both dogs tackle him and begin to lick him and play with him. Slowly, Maggot’s demeanour changes, and he begins to pet and play with them. In time, Maggot gently brings them to heel and calls you to join him for dinner.
    As you sit at the dinner table, Maggot asks if these fine beasts have names. You recount what happened in the Old Forest, and as you do so, you realize that the friendliness of the two dogs towards Maggot must be a sort of gift from Tom — could it be that they know each other?
    Over a hearty home-cooked meal, Maggot says that he was not one to keep beasts around, but these dogs seem rather fond of him, and they might make fine breeding stock for years to come. If any fierceness remains in their hearts, they’ll be fine protectors for his family. He thanks the Player-heroes for their aid and asks them if they’ll stay for the night.
    Come morning, Bilbo declares that he has had a wonder- ful little adventure, and enough proper research has been gathered for his book. He kindly thanks the Player-heroes for their involvement and declares that they all shall be invited to the next great party he throws, and every party to come.
    As time goes on, Bilbo becomes more reclusive, and the other Hobbits return to their lives. Gossip regarding their mischief fades away over the years, and life once again returns to normal in the Shire, for a few years at least...
