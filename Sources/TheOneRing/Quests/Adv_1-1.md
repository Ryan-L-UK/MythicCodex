# A Conspiricy Most Cracked

Mad Baggins is at it again and has gathered in Bag End a new cabal of adventurous spirits whom he has named the Conspirators of the Red Book. To gather notes for his book, he has asked these friends, under promise of payment and a bit of adventure, to help him confirm some important details about the history of the Shire as well as its people. The first and most important item is a map of the Shire that is kept locked away in the Mathom-House, at Michel Delving (The Capital), which he believes was sketched by none other than the Old Took himself! These conscripted conspirators will need to travel there, slip past any watch without arousing suspicion, and pilfer the ancient map before returning to Bag End.

> This should be the first scenario run, as it sets the stage for all the others. It occurs during the spring or summer of 1360 Shire Reckoning (2960 Third Age). The action begins at Bag End, and then moves on to Michel Delving (The Capital) and back.

# Off into the Blue

The first part of this adventure is little more than a Hobbit walking party, an easy entry into the life of an errant adventurer. It will take the Adventurers over the river west of Bywater and to the village of Waymeet, where they’ll need to avoid local gossip mongers.

> After quite a long walk under stars that shine bright after an afternoon of heavy rain, you’ve finally come to the round green door of Bag End, the home of the strange and famous Bilbo Baggins. Standing there upon the mat, you find yourself surrounded by distant relations. It appears Bilbo called for a collection of cousins to join him this evening. Just as one of you is about to ring the bell, the door is pulled open, and you see standing in the front hall none other than Master Baggins himself. He offers each of you an energetic greeting and quickly ushers you in with a plethora of _"Welcomes"_, _"Thank Yous"_, and _"Lovely To See Yous"_.
>
> Before you can gather your wits about you, you’ve been led into the parlour where a lovely fire, fresh mugs of ale, plates of food, and several cushioned chairs and sofas offer a much-needed spot of rest and relaxation. Bilbo, invites you each to take a sea, but takes none for himself.

Bilbo will pause for a moment to allow the aventurers to admire his fine collection of items on display in his home. After a few moments Baggins can no longer contain himself. He places one hand behind his back and another in his vest pocket, standing tall to ensure he has your attention.

> _“You are all, undoubtedly, curious as to why I’ve called you here this evening. Well, I am hoping you will partake in a little adventure! Nothing so grand as my own, I’m afraid: but in return for your aid, I will provide each of you with a place in my memoirs, and a fair share of my eternal gratitude.”_
>
> He grabs a glass of wine off the table and takes a sip, pausing for effect. _“Now, I know what you’re thinking: ‘There goes Old Bilbo again, taking after that Wizard Gandalf and sending you Hobbits off into the blue. Well, I can assure you it is nothing of the sort. Just a little trip to 'Michel Delving' and back to recover what one might call, a family heirloom of sorts from the Mathom-House. Its a map of the Shire, supposedly made by the Old Took himself, with all sorts of precious annotations. Now, I’ve sent many letters to the custodian, Malva Slowfoot, asking if I could have it back, I have even offered generous donations, but for some reason, she has provided no replies._
>
> _So, given we are talking about something that belonged to my grandfather, and that it wouldn't look out of place here, in Bag End. They wouldn't notice if it happened to 'vanish'._
>
> _Now, it is important you don’t alert that pesky dog that the Slowfoots have set to guard the place! Sharp as a tack, that beast, and he sniffs me out every time I’ve come near. Also, knowing that some of you place more value on local gossip than others, and even just being seen in the Company of ‘Mad Baggins’ might be enough to ruin your reputation forever. But for those of you with spirit, and well, I know you all have that in spades, you would leap at the chance to aid me with this errand of particular importance, my fellow hobbits, so what do you say?”_

Bilbo will offer each of them a fine night’s rest in one of the many spare bedrooms of Bag End, and a hearty breakfast, before telling them he plans on sending them out the door after second breakfast.

To keep the trip away from the prying eyes of the nosy Hobbits of Hobbiton and Bywater, Bilbo has laid out a path for the conspirators, instructing them to head north from Bag End into Overhill and turn west across the country for a few miles, before crossing a shallow point in the Water. Then, after crossing the Bywater Road, they will reach the East Road and set out west towards Waymeet, where they’ll take rest for the evening before arriving at Michel Delving the next day.

## Getting Across the Water

The morning dawns bright and clear, perfect for a nice walk about the Shire. The first true obstacle reveals itself soon after they leave Overhill a bridgeless rover crossing.

**Seasonal Changes** The recent rains have not only made the river swifter but also muddied the banks, making footing somewhat treacherous. You think a strong swimmer could cross it, but you might want to pick your path carefully. The river bed is known for becomeing loose silt and can be like quicksand to the untrained.

The Adventurers must now consider their circumstances and find a solution.

> Crossing the Water requires an **ATHLETICS** roll. Adventurers who pass a DC10, swim across with flair or can help others who find it harder to make their way across. Hobbits who fail their **ATHLETICS** roll return to the near bank, coughing and spluttering, and fully soaked.

_**Note:**_ A soaked creature will have **DISADVANTAGE** on ability checks.

> If the Adventurers look for other means of crossing, a successful **INVESTIGATION** roll allows them to spot a large hollow log on the other side of the Water, which could easily bear the weight of a Hobbit.

To retrieve the log, the Hobbits must summon their adventurous side and get inventive.

> For example, the feat can be accomplished by using a rope and hook (a **SURVIVAL** roll) or even by shooting an arrow with an attached line (a **ATTACK** roll). Success means that they manage to get a good hold on the log and can easily pull it to themselves. Another way could be to have the best swimmer among them get to the other side, fetch the log and swim back.

Dry or soaked, the Hobbits will eventually find a way, and reach Waymeet after a good walk on the East Road.

## Well Met in Waymeet

Waymeet itself is quite active on the evening when the Adventurers arrive, as the tables set outside the Walking Party Inn are still occupied, thanks to the fair weather and lengthening daylight hours. The locals are polite, though very curious about what brings a crowd of Hobbits so diverse this far west at such a late hour.

![Waymeet](http://localhost:8080/Sources/TheOneRing/Quests/AdvAssets/Adv1.1_Waymeet.png)

> Avoiding inquiries as to the nature of their business without offending the locals can be done with a successful **PERSUASION** roll. On a failure, they reveal a bit too much about their involvement with Mad Baggins, and the conversation soon dries up, among puzzled and disapproving looks.

| :-: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | "Did you see that shadowy figure last night? Even the dogs wouldn't bark at it..."   | A cloaked figure has been seen wandering the roads at night. Some say it's a Ranger, others a distant Elf. |
|  2  | "Old Farmer Maggot's prize pig gone missing, and not a single footprint in sight..." | Livestock are vanishing without a trace. No signs of predators; whispers of a ghostly beast abound.        |
|  3  | "They say the inn's new pie tastes like it's straight from the Shire's heart..."     | The innkeeper's new mushroom pie is a hit. Rumor has it, it's an Old Took family recipe.                   |
|  4  | "I heard there's a map, a treasure map, and it's hidden somewhere 'round here..."    | A map to Mad Baggins' hidden treasure is said to be somewhere in Waymeet, sparking a quiet frenzy.         |
|  5  | "Watch your pockets, lads. Sharkey's boys might be back for old times' sake..."      | Talk of Sharkey's men lurking about, seeking revenge, has the locals on edge.                              |
|  6  | "A walking tree, here in the Shire? Pull the other one, it's got bells on!"          | An old Hobbit claims to have seen Treebeard near the Shire, causing a stir of excitement and skepticism.   |

Finding lodging for the night proves a little harder... It seems that all beds at the Walking Party Inn are taken, booked by a group of pipe-weed merchants headed for Longbottom. Asking around, they are pointed to a local farmer, one Baldo Bunce, who appears to have some spare room in his stables. Bunce offers to let the Adventurers sleep in his premises (which are comfortable enough, given the warm nights and soft hay) — but only if they can drive off a huge and menacing **[Owl](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Owl.png)** that’s been troubling Gertrude, his poor old plough mule.

If the players accept, Bunce offers to pay for their meal that night at the Walking Party, before leading them to his farm, less than a quarter mile south of the Waymeet crossroads. He shows them into the barn and then brings them blankets, along with a small basket of some leftover bread and ale from the afternoon as an evening snack. Baldo never noses into their business and apologizes profusely for his lack of hospitality, saying he doesn’t have much room inside his small cottage. Nevertheless, he fully expects them to have that damned **[Owl](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Owl.png)** gone by morning. When Baldo is done talking, an eerie hoot rings out through the barn, as if on cue, and the tiny mule sitting idly in the rear of the place stirs.

> The Adventurers can get rid of the great **[Owl](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Owl.png)** if they politely inform him with a **INSIGHT** roll that there are no more mice in the barn and that he’s bothering Gertrude. If the roll is passed, the **[Owl](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Owl.png)** flies off almost as if he understood them. Alternatively, an **INTIMDATION** roll can serve as a form of intimidation, as will a **SURVIVAL** roll.

If the large bird is scared off rather than politely urged, it leaves, but first looks pointedly from the Adventurers to Gertrude, the mule, and hoots at her to which she replies with a brief bray. It seems almost as if the two are talking! The **[Owl](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Owl.png)** is commenting to the mule about how he was treated by the Adventurers and will inform the other animals he knows about these rude Hobbits (the Lore master should remember to make any future interactions with the beasts of the Shire more difficult). If they however choose to rid the barn of the **[Owl](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Owl.png)** by force, a fight will break out.

The rest of the evening passes uneventfully, and a few minutes after the rooster crows, Bunce wakes the characters and bids them a polite but firm farewell.

# Mathoms of Michel Delving

Setting out from Waymeet, the conspirators will arrive at Michel Delving by the end of the day. Here, they will begin their adventure in earnest, having to confusticate Bounders, confuse custodians, and face curious canines as they attempt the clandestine recovery of the Old Took’s map from the Mathom-House. Once the deed is done, they’ll need to make a hasty retreat from Michel Delving before their dubious activities are noticed!

![Michel Delving](http://localhost:8080/Sources/TheOneRing/Quests/AdvAssets/Adv1.1_MichelDelving.png)

After a bit of a stiff sleep in Bunce’s barn and a long westward walk, the conspirators finally reach the edges of Michel Delving upon the White Downs.

> You pass the spot where a southward path leads off from the main course of the East Road, just as the sun sets and the first stars begin to reveal themselves. Ahead, you get a good look at Michel Delving upon the White Downs. Quite a bit larger than Hobbiton, it is a tightly packed collection of homes built of wood, brick, and stone, and the occasional Hobbit-hole. But as the last of its people go about their evening business, your eye cannot help but be drawn to the massive smial (Hobbit Hole) to one side of the great cobblestone thoroughfare running through the centre of town: the Town Hole, seat of the Mayor of the Shire.
>
> But more important to your business is what lies south of the Town Hole, on an adjacent hillock not quite so tall and green. It is a large wooden building with a great red round door that is connected to the main road by way of a small stone path. This is the Mathom-House, the museum of the Shire, your destination.
>
> As candles flicker to life behind windows, and Hobbit folk settle in for the evening, you notice a handful of Hobbits carrying stout cudgels and tiny lanterns strolling about. Bounders, undoubtedly making their usual rounds. Best to avoid them, though, lest your mischief be discovered and thwarted.

## Burglars in Michel Delving

The conspirators face their greatest challenge so far — to reach the Mathom-House without anyone noticing, and to gain access to it.

> To get up to the Mathom-House without the Bounders noticing requires each character to pass a **STEALTH** roll. Failure means a Bounder approaches and questions them.
>
> The Bounder approaching the conspirators is Ada Burrows, a young and enthusiastic Hobbit from Little Delving. This is one of her first assignments, and she takes her duty to ask questions of wanderers found outside after nightfall very seriously.

> Convincing Ada that they are doing nothing untoward requires the Adventurers to make a roll of PERSUADE — or **PERSUASION**, should they try to confuse her with clever words or distractions.

Failing to convince Ada worsens the conspirators' predicament considerably — the Bounder questions them extensively before she lets them go, and then she walks to the Mathom-House and locks the front door! Now it will be impossible to gain entrance through it.

Inspecting the grounds surrounding the Mathom-House for other ways to enter reveals that, though the door is locked, and the windows barred, there is a small skylight opening on the roof. Additionally, at some distance from the Mathom-House and sticking out of the side of the hill upon which the museum sits is an old door that may lead into the basement of the establishment.

> Climbing up to the roof requires a roll of **ATHLETICS**. Failure results in a fall causing the loss of 3 Endurance points. If two or more Adventurers fail the roll, they get caught up in a tumbled mess and everyone lands with a loud clatter that alerts the surprise guest waiting inside!

Once up there, the conspirators find the skylight to be unlocked. Landing safely on the floor inside the main hall of the Mathom-House requires a second **ATHLETICS** roll (for the consequences of failure, see above).

Characters choosing to try the door on the side of the hill find that it leads to a narrow, cluttered underground chamber, a basement filled with all kinds of forgotten trinkets and thick cobwebs. In fact, a small pack of rats has taken up residence here, fearful of the guardian that lives on the ground floor.

> Scaring the rats off causes them to scurry away noisily and awaken the guard dog: avoiding this requires a successful **STEALTH** roll.

A trapdoor leading into the Mathom-House opens in the ceiling of the cellar, above a massive pile of antique pots and pans. To move them aside carefully requires another successful **STEALTH** roll, lest they clatter to the floor and make all manner of noise (and awaken the guardian).

## The Mathom-House, Inside and Out

Whether they entered the Mathom-House by way of the unlocked main door, or through the roof or the basement, the conspirators find themselves inside a great, high-ceilinged series of rooms, containing an impressive display of artefacts from across the history of the Shire. Shelves of books chronicling family genealogies and recipes passed down for generations line the walls, while a set of perfectly polished diamond studs are set on a pedestal under glass, and a pair of strange, crossed walking sticks are mounted on one wall. Countless other knick-knacks and Mathoms are on display. From old brass buttons mounted on a velvet board, to a gleaming coat of silver rings set to rest on a post in the corner. Though a wonder to behold, it is going to take a bit of doing to find the Old Took’s map in this collection!

But the most concerning sight appearing in front of the searching conspirators as they enter is the grey and brown furred terrier, the fearsome guard dog kept by Malva the custodian! If the Adventurers gained access to the museum without making noise, the dog is curled up asleep under a writing desk, letting out heavy snores. If they made noise entering, the terrier (whose name is “Firework”) is well awake.

> The Lore master is encouraged to remind any players who bring up the idea of purloining any of the choicer Mathoms in the Mathom-House that such behaviour is unbecoming of a respectable Hobbit. It’s one thing to take something on a mission sponsored by Bilbo Baggins himself, but quite another to take advantage of the situation! Characters that even bring up such an act should be ashamed of themselves.

> If the dog is asleep, the Adventurers may search for the map, but must do so quietly. This requires three successful **INVESTIGATION** rolls — failing twice means they make noise. Once three successful rolls are achieved, the conspirators locate the Old Took’s map — buried behind a stack of cookbooks on the bottom shelf of one of the bookcases. It is in surprisingly good condition, if a bit creased.

> If the dog is awake, or if the Adventurers rouse him by failing two **INVESTIGATION** rolls, the dog eyes them before letting out an inquisitive bark. He is not fierce, but friendly and energetic. Unfortunately, he expresses his excitement at having found new friends by barking. Calming the dog requires a **INSIGHT** roll. If the roll succeeds, then the dog is lulled back to sleep for the entire search.
>
> If Firework is not pacified, his barking rattles the nerves of the conspirators, who fear the noise will draw the attention of some local Hobbit — a Bounder, or worse, a Sherriff!

> Actually, no one is alarmed by Firework’s antics, and the only consequence of his barking is that the improvised burglars all lose 1 point of Hope due to fear of being discovered!

## Slipping out of Town

Once they have what they came for, the conspirators can easily unlock the front door from the inside and escape.

If Firework has been alerted, slipping out of Michel Delving will require some further planning to avoid someone noticing a group of sneaking Hobbits followed by a barking dog. If the Adventurers are not wary on the way out, a Bounder or two might still notice them slip away and remember their faces in days to come.

Finally, if they were not explicitly careful, the conspirators have likely left evidence that something is missing from the Mathom-House. By mid-morning of the next day, the news that someone broke into the Mathom-House is all over Michel Delving, and within a few more it spreads across the Westfarthing.

# Epilogue

Once the conspirators return to Bag End, the Lore master should read the following text:

> After your successful recovery of the Old Took’s map of the Shire and swift journey home, you’re greeted by the green door of Bag End being thrown open like a pop gun to reveal a grinning Bilbo standing on the doorstep, walking stick in hand. “You found it! Wonderful, simply wonderful!”
>
> Though eager, Bilbo ushers you in with a hasty wave of his hand. “Come on, we’ll need to review my grandfather’s map quickly tonight if we’re to set off on our next adventure! This remarkable find of yours makes me believe I’m quite ready for another adventure!”

Bilbo and the other conspirators can relax for a time. Bilbo prepares a fine meal for everyone and asks about the whole affair. After hearing the story, he cannot help but laugh, adding that he is ready to join them on their next adventure!
