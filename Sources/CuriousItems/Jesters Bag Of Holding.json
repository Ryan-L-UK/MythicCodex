{"customIndicator":"RML","name":"Jesters Bag Of Holding","rarity":"uncommon","type":"Wondrous Item","source":"Homebrew","I0D":"A bag of holding is an ordinary bag that has been enchanted so that the interior of the bag opens on a nondimensional space. This nondimensional space is considerably larger than the interior of the bag and allows the user to store and retrieve objects without becoming encumbered. Bags such as these are rare and are especially useful for adventurers for obvious reasons. ","I1D":"Unfortunately, the magic on this bag is failing, and any attempt to put an item into the bag fails. However, violently shaking the bag seems to cause various items to fall out of it."}
