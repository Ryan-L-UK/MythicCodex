  "I0D": "This dark silver shield is stylized in the striped likeness of a badger's face. While holding this shield, you can't be moved more than 5 feet against your will at a time.",
  "I1D": "The shield has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the shield's charges to cause a spectral badger to emerge from the shield and lash back out at the attacker. The attacking creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d4 + 3 slashing damage."
