Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.","You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be {@condition charmed} on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.","All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: {@spell fly}, {@spell invisibility}, {@spell levitate}, and {@spell protection from evil and good}.","In addition, the Cli lyre can be used to cast {@spell stone shape}, {@spell wall of fire}, and {@spell wind wall}."],"attachedSpells":["stone shape","fly","invisibility","levitate","protection from evil and good","wall of fire","wind wall"],"lootTables":["Magic Item Table G"],"hasFluffImages":true}
