# Description

The stone is large, around the size of a coconut, and is filled with a
curious red liquid. The liquid inside is a deep crimson and doesnt flow
like water. It seems to have a thickness to it. The stone walls are thick
and a look at the stone suggests that it has been around for hundreds of
years, and probably will continue to do so.

## The Transition

The possessor will start to transition to a Blood Bound Sorcerer, all the while they are holding the stone. The desire to drink blood will come almost immediately, maybe not in the way they see. As new abilities start to awaken inside themselves, they will need to 'sustain' their new power with blood. This need not be a regular thing, although will need to be often enough so not to lose their power.

Any abilities obtained before the transition will remain, but the ability to claim new ones from the previous origin will no longer be possible.

The carrier also gains a modified bite ability. If the user attempts to bite a target they deal 1d8 + Dex, +1d8 necrotic with half the total damage returned as 'Life Leach'.

# Blood Bound Sorcerer

Your magic comes from a strange connection to the intersection of body and soul that is found deep in blood. You may not even know why, but your very being is dyed crimson, and ancient magic is awakening within you.

Blood magic isn’t seen very often in most worlds, and it’s not entirely known where it comes from. You might have undergone a ritual that stoked the blood within you, granting you power at great sacrifice to yourself or others. Perhaps one of your ancestors was a powerful shapechanger, and an aspect of their abilities was passed on to you. Whatever the reason, and whether you want it or not, the power is there and your blood calls you to use it.

## Hemic Resilience

**1st-level Blood Bound feature**

As your mystical blood awakens within you, your body hardens and fortifies itself against harm. Your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

Additionally, when you aren't wearing armor, you can calculate your AC as 11 + your Constitution modifier.

## Bloodspring

**1st-level Blood Bound feature**

Your skill with blood allows you to fuel spells with your own raw life force. As an action, you can regain one expended spell slot, which must be of a level that is equal to or less than half your sorcerer level (rounded up), and can be no higher in level than 6th. Immediately after regaining a spell slot in this way, your current hit points are reduced by 5 per level of the spell slot regained, or 10 per slot level if the spell slot is 3rd level or higher.

If regaining a spell slot with this feature reduces you to 0 hit points, you die instantly.

## Crimson Cascade

**6th-level Blood Bound feature**

You can drain the life from your foes with your spells. When you use one or more Metamagic options on a spell, you can choose one creature affected by the spell. If the creature isn’t immune to necrotic damage, its current hit points are reduced by an amount equal to 1d8 per sorcery point spent on the spell, and you gain temporary hit points equal to the amount of hit points the creature lost. This reduction to current hit points is just barely perceptible, and doesn’t count as damage.

Additionally, whenever you have temporary hit points and gain more, you can spend 1 sorcery point to add the gained temporary hit points to your current total, rather than deciding whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones.

## Hemomorph

**14th-level Blood Bound feature**

The mutability of your form and the enduring nature of your blood makes you more resilient to damage. When you aren't wearing armor you can calculate your AC as 12 + your Constitution modifier, and whenever you finish a long rest you can gain temporary hit points equal to your sorcerer level.

Additionally, you gain the ability to draw upon the arcane potential in your blood to empower yourself. As a bonus action, you can spend 6 sorcery points to enter a state of magical and physical focus. For 1 minute your eyes and skin glow with a red haze, and you gain the following benefits:

- You have proficiency in Dexterity saving throws.
- You have advantage on spell attack rolls against targets within 15 feet of you, and being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged spell attack rolls.
- Any creature within 15 feet of you has disadvantage on the first saving throw it makes against each spell you cast.
- You have a +10 bonus to Strength and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

## Bloodsurge

**18th-level Blood Bound feature**

Your supernatural form allows you to survive even deadly wounds. Any critical hit against you counts as a normal hit instead, and at the start of each of your turns you regain hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) if you have no more than half of your hit points remaining. You gain this benefit even if you have 0 hit points, as long as you are not dead.

## Optional Subclass Feature: Blood Spells

**Optional 1st-level Blood Bound feature**

<em> With the release of **Tasha's Cauldron of Everything**, sorcerer subclasses have been released that gain additional spells at certain levels. More importantly, these subclasses gain limited access to the warlock and wizard spell lists. To bring this subclass to a comparable level of versatility, you can gain this optional subclass feature with the approval of your DM.</em>

You learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Blood Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an enchantment or necromancy spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.
