      The Temple Of Virtuous Probability
    </h1>
    <p>
      Most of the priests will not talk beyond their prayers, it would appear
      they have to undergo some form of vow of silence. The only exception to
      this rule is when they meet in the house of discussion, this is about the
      only time they are allowed to break that vow.
    </p>
    <p>
      All worshipers of the Good Mother surrender their names upon joining as a
      priest, and are simply referred to by brother or sister, unless you have a
      more ornate title.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walk with their head bowed most of the time, and a hood covering
      their face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only priests to be able to speak freely outside of the house of
      discussion are: The High priest, The Voice &amp; The Astronomer of Solaris

    <p class="caption">The Temple Of Virtuous Probability</p>
    <h2 id="r1-main-temple">R1: Main Temple</h2>
    <p>
      This area is where the main congregation will go during the various
      religious ceremonies and readings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike most temples you are used to, the congregation sit at tables and
      face one another. They then look towards the priests who sit at the high
      table and will talk. The high priest would sit in the centre. A look
      around the room will find a few CP’s scattered on the floor that have
      dropped from people’s pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chair in the centre has a variety of antlers to make it more ornate.
      Around the back are a variety of stained glasses depicting scenes from
      various stories from the book of the good mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      A copy of the book of the good mother can be found on the table. Its
      stories are little more than metaphors, with a small set of letters from
      the good mother to her ‘Pack’.
    </p>
    <h2 id="r2-sacred-arcana-effect">R2: Sacred Arcana Effect</h2>
    <p>
      There are two of these arcane magical effects taking place. In the centre
      of each is a priest chanting to continue the effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      These act like a sacred flame, and at least one more be going at all
      times. The legend says that if both were to go out at any time, the temple
      of the good mother shall fall, and all those within 1000 miles will pay
      the price. (It talks of potential plagues, or the unleashing of demons.)
    </p>
    <h2 id="r3-the-priests-temple">R3: The Priests Temple</h2>
    <p>
      Whilst the priests will often pray with the congregation, the additional
      morning, afternoon and evening prayers will be done in the privacy of the
      small temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arcane symbols painted on the floor are to remind each of the priest
      of the various elements that make up life itself.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Terra</li>
      <li>Aqua</li>
      <li>Solaris</li>
      <li>Knowledge</li>
      <li>Arcana</li>
      <li>Destruction</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The book upon the lectern appears to be in a gibberish at first glance,
      the language almost made up.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A closer inspection will reveal that it is actually written from right
        to left, and uses approximately 10 different languages, and each word
        appears to change between them.
      </li>
      <li>
        To read it, one would not only need to be able to read words written
        backwards, they would also need to know each dialect to glean any
        meaning.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="r4-house-of-discussion">R4: House of Discussion</h2>
    <p>
      A table sits in the centre, with a variety of candles in the centre, each
      one has been ignited and snuffed hundreds of times, to the point where the
      very wax itself has rooted the various candelabras to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a place for all the priests to come together to discuss or argue
      various religious plights. It is usually divided into two different sides,
      which appear to represent conflicting viewpoints.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a large set of dents and nail marks in the door. It would seem
      this is where a list of issues is posted before they meet, however the
      paper at the moment has simply one phrase in large font ‘The Arcanis
      Ring’.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a single impartial priest elected by all the members and is known
      as ‘the voice’. They must remain neutral on all issues, and whilst they do
      find join for the various prays, they themselves will often be sequestered
      in their private office, buried in books, notes and letters. These are the
      various teachings and word of the Good Mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also a viewing gallery where members of the public can go to
      oversee the debates if they wish. Although judging by the way the temple
      is run, you believe this has not been an option utilised by the public in
      some time.
    </p>
    <h2 id="r5-office-of-the-voice">R5: Office of The Voice</h2>
    <p>
      The office of the voice is stacked from floor to ceiling with books,
      scrolls, parchment and various literature. You estimate it would take
      several life times to have collected this much, however whilst the paper
      appears strewn about the room, it would appear the voice has it in some
      form of order. If asked to produce any specific notes at a moment’s
      notice, they will be able to find it fairly easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice can be found in here if someone wished to speak with them for
      any reason.
    </p>
    <h2 id="r6-bed-chamber">R6: Bed Chamber</h2>
    <p>
      The room is packed with a variety of bunk beds, most of them triple, but
      in one extreme and slightly precarious case, there is a quadruple bunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insider here there can also be found a small chest belonging to each
      priest, there are intended for personal items. Inside each chest the same
      thing can be found:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A scroll with a depiction of the good mother</li>
      <li>A small book of some of the key teachings of the good mother</li>
      <li>A small metal thorn crown, which is worn for ceremonial purposes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="r7-arcane-practise-rooms">R7: Arcane Practise Rooms</h2>
    <p>
      The smaller of the two rooms is for basic conjuring, and simple spells and
      arcana.
    </p>
    <p>
      The larger is a magical shooting range. This is a chance for wielders of
      the arcana to practise their skills. Whilst most of the priests are able
      to wield magic, they tend to predominately learn healing spells. This is
      further confirmed by the lack of use of the spell range, which has a
      sizable layer of dust everywhere.
    </p>
    <h2 id="r8-treasury-and-accounting">R8: Treasury and Accounting</h2>
    <p>
      Both the treasury and accounting offices have signs on the door, but both
      are magically locked. Given the nature of the work they do, they are not
      permitted to have visitors and can only be let out by the high priest, or
      in the case of an emergency, they will be released automatically.
    </p>
    <h2 id="r9-high-priest-office">R9: High Priest office</h2>
    <p>
      The office of the high priest is fairly ornate and also appears decorated
      in yet more large and elaborate antlers and horns. There is a sign on the
      door.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The high priest does not mince his words, and will not allow anyone to
        interfere with those seeking atonement. The temple is a haven of
        sanctuary, and supersedes the watch. (Much to the watch’s distress).
      </li>
      <li>
        He will pretty much want to leave straight away and head over to the
        house of discussion and will invite players to join in the observation
        room.
      </li>
      <li>He will be able to explain the situation with the Arcanis Ring</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="r10-cells-and-atonement-room">R10: Cells and Atonement Room</h2>
    <p>
      There is no way to sugar coat this, it’s clear this is a place of
      religious torture. It is quickly clear why the watch doesn’t mind so much
      about criminals seeking atonement here. Whilst the good mother preaches of
      curing one of religious sin. It doesn’t say they won’t flog, beat, and
      even flay the sin out of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cells here have a few people in here, most of them are so frightened
      of anyone coming near the cells, they will back away and hide in the
      corner averting their eyes. The only exception is the cunning man.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        He will be being treated for his bite by one of the priests, wincing in
        pain as he does so.
      </li>
      <li>
        He will be wild eyed and fearing for his life. He will also be mouthing
        on about the moon.
      </li>
      <li>
        He has been bitten by one of the werewolves (Ulrick), and fears he has
        been infected as punishment for his actions. (Blowing the cover of The
        Pet Shop) He will be potentially tortured, but the priests are a little
        concerned about the Lycanthrope virus he may now be infected with.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="r11-potions-store">R11: Potions Store</h2>
    <p>
      The potions store contains a variety of interesting and unusual potions.
      Most appear to be little more than herbal remedies, but a few catch your
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Draught of the Teetotaler: for the next 24 hours drinking hard liquor has
      the same effect on you as drinking water, and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elixir of Dubious Augmentation: for 24 hours, the values of your lowest
      ability score and your highest ability score are swapped, ties determined
      by the DM.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dragons Bite: Picture of a Dragon on the bottle and it is a crimson
      red. The potion turns the user into a kobold for 24 hours.
    </p>
    <h2 id="r12-chamber-of-preparation">R12: Chamber of Preparation</h2>
    <p>
      This is a place where the deceased are prepared for burial and entrance to
      the afterlife. They are usually accompanied by a collective prayer and
      chant during the process. The more respected (or more you pay) the more
      priests attend and the more chance you have of ascending.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place is empty, and smells strongly of chemicals, presumably to clean
      it.
    </p>
    <h2 id="r14-toilets">R14: Toilets</h2>
    <p>
      There isn’t much to say about this room, little more than its where the
      shit goes down.
    </p>
    <h2 id="r15-meditation-room">R15: Meditation room</h2>
    <p>
      A simple room of meditation and reflection, there is a cushion on the
      floor for a priest to be seated. It would appear the room can be locked
      from the inside and there is a clothes hook on the back of the door. You
      have reason to believe that someone wishing to use this space would lock
      the door, remove all their clothes and meditate naked.
    </p>
    <h2 id="r16-study-room">R16: Study Room</h2>
    <p>
      The room is little more than an old chair and worn desk with a very
      heavily used quill and a near empty ink pot. Whilst this room may be a
      place of study, it’s hard to believe many people use it.
    </p>
    <h2 id="r17-teaching-room">R17: Teaching Room</h2>
    <p>
      This is a place for imparting wisdom, the desks are simple, each with a
      quill and ink well. At the front a lectern with a place for a book. The
      room itself is completely empty, although a look around will suggest it
      has been used recently. Although, only the first few seats, suggesting
      there are new brothers and sisters.
    </p>
    <h2 id="r18-the-room-of-truth">R18: The Room of Truth</h2>
    <p>
      This room is seldom used, but the intention is to place someone in the
      centre of the arcane ring and they will tell the truth, regardless of
      their own personal desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary use of this room is in the form of a trial. This would
      normally be reserved for trials involving members of the priesthood,
      although history shows in some extreme cases, there have been trials of
      those accused of heinous crimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cunning Man will likely end up here, once he has been thoroughly
      interrogated.
    </p>
    <p>
      They will then be sentences to the level of atonement. This in most cases
      would just be a parade through the streets to bare their sins. However, in
      some extreme cases it has been to cast aside their former life and become
      a priest of the good mother.

    <h2 id="r19-terra-pavilion">R19: Terra Pavilion</h2>
    <p>
      An incredibly warm room, it is filled with a variety of herbs and plants
      from across the region.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room is lit, not by windows but by a glowing magical orb floating just
      below the ceiling. It appears to change colour as the day goes on to
      symbolise a day night cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many strange and exotic plants within. Most are medicinal, but
      there are few more strange and wonderous ones. Including a few toxic and
      torturous ones. The ones that catch your eye:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Flame Clove: a garlic-like herb imbued with energy from the Plane of
        Fire. Raw flame clove contains a mild but unpleasant poison (ingested;
        Con DC 13 initial damage 1d6 fire). When boiled in salt water and
        crushed and blended into food, however, flame clove has a taste similar
        to garlic and keeps hot food hot for 1d4 days without drying out and
        with no outside heat source. A single healthy mature bulb sells for 20
        gp.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Phantom Floweror Mirage Flower is able to project dozens of ghostly
        copies of itself in order to fool creatures that wish to harm the plant.
        It is a useful ingredient in many potions, but its unique ability makes
        it frustrating to harvest.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Claymore Mushroom: is a mushroom that explodes when you step on it.
        This has been raised and surrounded by glass.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ripplebark: Bracket fungus that resembles rotting flesh. It is edible
        and tastes good roasted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Poison Ivy: Contact with skin can cause a rash that is itchy for 1d4
        days. Consuming the plant will make one nauseous and feverish for 3d4
        days. Aloe and other healing ointments make the itch tolerable, but
        there is no cure for the ailments when eating the plant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bloodberry Bush: Red berries and heart-shaped reddish- green leaves
        characterized this small bush. If the berries are consumed the poison is
        so extreme that there is no known cure and it is estimated that they
        have 1d6 days before death.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="r20-trinkets-and-artefacts">R20: Trinkets and Artefacts</h2>
    <p>
      This room is little more than a religious display room. The cases are full
      of various religious artefacts. In some cases, these are the original
      scrolls from the letters of the good mother, as well as some of the first
      drafts of the Book of the good mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      There can also be found a few various gold and silver crowns and tiaras
      which are claimed to have belonged to the good mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      One key thing that can be seen, located inside a case of 1inch thick glass
      is crown made of two small animal antlers. A look around the room reveals
      many pieces of artwork depicting the Good Mother, and in all of them she
      is wearing a crown similar to this.

    <p>
      A wild eyed Tiefling will be frantically running around the room. He will
      be moving paper and scrolls to different parts of the room. Picking them
      up again and moving them to somewhere else. It is hard to tell if there is
      a system.
    </p>
    <p>
      He will be babbling about changes to the universe and the Solaris model is
      wrong. He will also say that the sun is pulsing. He will burst from the
      room suddenly, leaving a trail of flying paper and run for the
      observatory. Inside he will be looking at the telescope.
    </p>
    <h2 id="r22-the-solaris-observatory">R22: The Solaris Observatory</h2>
    <p>
      A place of much wonder is the Solaris Observatory. Inside you can find
      book cases crammed full of star charts, astrological maps, as well as
      subtle changes in the moon and suns rotations.
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple and basic planetary orrery can also be found, it shows several
      planets orbiting a sun, although it appears to have been ‘modified’
      recently. The main things of note are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Several of the wires the planets sit on have been bent, so their orbits
        sit differently.
      </li>
      <li>
        A few of the planets have been removed and stuck on to other planets to
        act as moons, rather than celestial bodies in their own right.
      </li>
      <li>
        ACTION – Lastly when he has an audience he will call that he has the
        answer, and will take one of the parties weapons, and smash the sun at
        the centre. He will then pick up the pieces of what remains and crudely
        create a trio of smaller starts in the centre. You can look through the
        telescope but there are so many filters and adjustments over the lens,
        obviously tailored to look for something ultra-specific, everything
        appears black and out of focus. It is pointed at the sun. If Talin
        looks, it’s possible to make out three shapes. Everyone else will just
        see a blur, that one would get from staring directly into the sun.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="r23-stairwells-various">R23: Stairwells (Various)</h2>
    <p>
      There is a sign that marks: Grand Library and Ring of Arcanis. The stairs
      appear to have a small rope barrier in front of them to deter the general
      public.
    </p>
    <p>No priests appear to go anywhere near it.</p>
    <h1 id="the-grand-library">The Grand Library</h1>
    <h2 id="general-notes">General Notes</h2>
    <p>
      The grand library has been trashed, there are books and paper everywhere.
      It would seem looking at it, like a small tornado had been through here.
      The Arcanis Ring will be dripping with old dry blood. It is actually hard
      to tell that there was even remains of someone there. The only clue you
      have is the robes, which have acted as a sponge soaking up some of the
      blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many books, most of them talk of the history and stories of the
      good mother, as well as lore of the world. There is even a copy of ‘Tales
      From the North, East And South there’. Although they talk more of the life
      of Alaundo, and not much else.
