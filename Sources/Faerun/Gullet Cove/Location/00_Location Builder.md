# The Market District

## General Notes

You wander through the streets of Gullet Cove, and come across the market, which is located in the very centre of town. It seems that the vendors are organised by raw materials and commodities on one half of the market, finished products on the other half. The market is known for being a pretty rough and tumble place, and is astonishingly well-kempt. The most important thing about the market is no two days are the same, so expect the venders and their wares to change regularly.

The merchants of the town are a proud people and take pride in their wares. Be warned that whilst bartering is certainly encouraged, some merchants wonâ€™t take kindly to the suggestion their wares are sub-standard.

## The Copper Pitcher

Owned by Oakie Thompson and Mokie Thompson; a pair of twin spaniels who finish each others sentences. The Copper Pitcher is a bric-a-brac stand, with dozens of different items all in differing states of disrepair. There is seldom anything of real value here, but occasionally they have been known to stumble upon the odd random magical item. Although they would never know its worth unless someone told them.

| Item                     | Cost | Description                                                                                                       |

## The Elven Pastry Kitchen

On the edge of the market is a small cobblestone building with a decently built straw roof called The Elven Pastry Kitchen. A large open window opens onto the street with a small counter displaying a variety of delectible items.

This bakeshop is known for baking rolls in the shapes of various small animals. There is a fair skinned adorably short halfling, Seraphina Stoutbridge.

| :---------------- | :--: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| The Fire Ball     | 2sp  | A perculiar pastry, it is little more than a simple roll. But lurking inside are a variety of local chillipeppers. Caution Hot. |

## The Fighters Sword

## The Futures Nigh

The hooded cloaked fortune-teller uses divination magic to predict the future and tell your fortune. How true it is, depends on how much you would like to read into it, but plenty of people seem to visit her. Each reading will set you back 15sp.

## Hometown Hook

Run by a renown fisher of Gullet Cove, Brume Copperwelt. This oversized fish stall is always well stocked with the fresh catch of the day. A halfling with unrivalled ambition, Brume has a fleet of small finishing vessels that work for him, and his stock truly is of the finest quality.

Brume himself is a simple halfling with a huge belly and a pipe never out of his lips. His stall is one of a kind with a revolutionary cooling system designed by Timorey.

| Item           | Cost | Description                                                                                                                         |
| :------------- | :--: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trout          | 5cp  | Appearing good quality, some of the trout have a small rainbow streak down their side.                                              |
| Catfish        | 8cp  | An oversized catfish, its price is certainly fair. Beside it, catfish cavear can also be bought by the cup.                         |
| Catfish Cavear | 4cp  | A subtle flavour, the cavear is good, and given its origin, much cheaper than the sturgen variety.                                  |
| Quipper        | 2sp  | With sharp teeth, this piranha type fish would certainly pack a bite. The fish on display looks delicious.                          |
| Mako Shark     | 1gp  | With only the fin for sale, anything from a shark will always carry a heavy price tag. Similar to tuna, this is a fine cut of fish. |
| Bream          | 1sp  | A small fish, the breams scales shine in the sun. There are not many left, seems like its been a good seller today.                 |
| Sprats         | 2cp  | This small fish serves as little more than a quick snack. Smoked with both oak and maple wood, the flavour is exceptional.          |

## Nip & Tuck

Sharing a stand with Smell My Posy, the speciality team of Nip & Tuck specialise in legal drugs and narcotics. They have previously falling foul of the tainted catnip and anise, however not any more. Taking care to source their stock direct from the ships, and only in sealed containers, it would seem they have learned their lesson.

| Item               | Cost | Description                                                                             |
| :----------------- | :--: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Catnip Pouch (x1)  | 27sp | A small pouch of good quality catnip.                                                   |
| Catnip Pouch (x10) | 22gp | An oversized pouch of good quality catnip.                                              |
| Anise Pouch (x1)   | 34sp | A small pouch of good quality anise.                                                    |
| Anise Pouch (x10)  | 29gp | An oversized pouch of good quality anise.                                               |
| Home Blend (x2)    | 8gp  | The home blend is a special combination of both anise and catnip, designed for couples. |
| Moss Cove Tobacco  | 8gp  | A local batch of tobacco, it is best smoked in a pipe. The longer the stem the better.  |

## Nights Brooch

Owned by Felicity Flop, a tiny cat who tinkles when she moves, her ginger fur braided with dozens of gems. The Nights Brooch is a small, mobile cart selling jewellery, particularly pearls pressed into seashells. She herself is nice enough, but her wares are somewhat questionable.

| Item                | Cost | Description                                                                                                              |
| :------------------ | :--: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ruby Ring           | 3gp  | This ring looks like its full of potential, but is little more than a regular ruby ring. It does at least fit well.      |
| Pearl Neckless      | 2gp  | the pearls on this chain are at least real, but the name has generated some laughing from the towns folk.                |
| Glass Gem           | 4gp  | A fine cut piece of glass, an unsuspecting townsfolk would be forgiven for thinking this is real.                        |
| The Dream Diamond   | 10gp | The â€˜Dream Diamondâ€™ is aptly named, as you must be dreaming if you think its a diamond, and downright insane to buy it.  |
| Ring of Free Action | 5gp  | The band is a collectionf of silver chainlinks with a blue rectangular cut gem in the centre. It certainly looks pretty. |
| Waterdeep Sapphire  | 2gp  | There are a collection of Sapphires on the table in various sizes and qualities. One of the few gems here that are real! |

## Smell My Posy

Owned by McIvor Glistenhame, a half-elf with a constant frown of concentration. Smell My Posy is a small flower stand, with artfully arranged bouquets of roses, delicately laced with dried seaweed. She also has a stock of various plants and seeds, but most of them are little more than decorative items.

| Item           | Cost | Description                                                                                             |
| :------------- | :--: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bellrue        | 5cp  | It is a weed, it has large flowers and in songs it is associated with a city.                           |
| Bronzeleaf     | 8cp  | It is a small plant, it has green flowers and it is commonly used in broths.                            |
| Laketongue     | 4cp  | It is a sweet-smelling cactus, it has bulbous capsules and itâ€™s roots are used as a cure for headaches. |
| Dragon-Blossom | 2sp  | It is a beautiful plant, it has small berries and it can be made into a potent soup.                    |
| Bane Cherry    | 1gp  | It is a grass, it has copper flowers and it is best boiled.                                             |

# Closed Shops

## The Calm Train

Previously the home of a reputable narcotics cafe, it has long since closed down. The doors have been shut for many moons, however that has only served to hide the illegal activities going on beneath the surface. Under the calm train is â€˜The Pet Shopâ€™, an illegal action space for awoken animals to be traded and bartered to the highest bidder. Since the incident with the Wereshark, the doors have since been sealed up tight by The Watch, and they have a guard regularly patrolling the closed stores to ensure nothing illegal is taking place.
