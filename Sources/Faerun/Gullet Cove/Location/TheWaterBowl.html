    <p>
      The Water Bowl is a well-kept tavern with just enough frills and rough
      edges to make most feel comfortable. The dining room has a bar and several
      tables, enough to comfortably hold up to 30. The morning meal here is a
      pleasant combination of bread and honey mixed with cinnamon. A handful of
      commoners are here eating breakfast.

    <p>
      Between the outside light through the open windows or the green driftglobe
      over the bar, the dining room is brightly lit.
