The forest of the sleepless is an interesting name as the area comprises of both meadows, forests as well as a barren wasteland.

The forest is dense to the left, nearest to the [Theatre Of Dreams](https://www.notion.so/Theatre-Of-Dreams-7c665f7eb9ae4d84badb05c1ae8a23c7), the middle area becomes a bit more meadow like, with the odd patch of trees. The right closest to the [The Palace Of Nightmares](https://www.notion.so/The-Palace-Of-Nightmares-000b959a9e244fad9273434b6a6bf882) is a destroyed barren wasteland.

A look at the waste land, will highlight that it has crossed the halfway point. Highlighting the demons torment.
