## General Notes

- The Theatre Of Dreams is the place all dreamers will visit at one point or another. It comprises multiple rooms, each one of which tailors to the individual dreamer.
- The Theatre of Dreams can, and usually does host more than one dreamer at a time. There are many dreamers still here in fact, but all will view visitors as little more than ghosts. Or worse, voices.
- There is also a lot of damage, several of the rooms have been destroyed, and there appears to be an abundance of plant matter around.

## 1: The Grand Entrance

- A walk to the Theatre Of Dreams is a simple one. You need only follow the stone road and you will arrive at the main steps of the theatre.
- The way is lined with a variety of trees of a variety of colours, each of them appears to have been meticulously placed. But it would appear that some of them have grown wild, where as others appear to have been well maintained. There is no logic or pattern to it however, it appears random. A closer inspection will highlight that not just the trees, but the grasses, moss, everything has grown wild, not just the main tree itself.
- On the other side of the trees is a tall golden fence, evenly spaced with tall brick columns of grey stone. The fence stands almost 8 feet high and a look through the bars will show you why.
- Looking out you will see an expanse of nothing. To fall, would mean falling into the nothingness of space for eternity. Also factoring the warning from [Lucienne](https://www.notion.so/Lucienne-69ee776dfde64874b0398f8e77ee7625) falling would probably result in the loss of ones mind for the rest of time.

## 2: Front Stairs

- Either side of the stairs stands a once well carved statue. The features of the statues appear to have worn away, as if a thousand years have passed. Although a look to the ground and you can see the dust pile there.
- The stairs themselves appear cracked and many of the stone slabs that make up the floor are cracked and deformed. A closer glance will find that these are footprints, what made them is unclear, but its clearly big.
- Several of the stones have a large amount of plant growth breaking through the grouting, but again, it seems random.

## 3: The Main Entrance

- The floor is an elaborate marble, several bushes line the edge along with a small shop with a sign that says: [Vake’s Dreamland Emporium](https://www.notion.so/Vake-s-Dreamland-Emporium-65a444cb9bb247a6bcba9524323bf670)
- Vake will have no idea what came through, having been on a break for daylight hours.
- This room has a large smashed chandelier inside. It would appear to have been ripped from the ceiling. Although the reason why remains unclear.
- The tiles on the floor are also smashed and dented which make footprints. You’re not sure what came through here, but the only thing you can say for sure is that it was big.
- To the right is the bathroom, walking in there will find a dreamer hiding with no trousers at all. He appears to be talking to himself in the mirror, trying to reason about how will he be able to go back to class without his trousers.

## 4: The Stairs Of Branching Possibilities

- There are a variety of routes which lead to different aspects of the Theatre Of Dreams, but it would certainly seem that this is the main route. Dreamers may ascend the stairs and branch towards their own dream based narratives from here.
- There are a few seats and signs, and dreamers appear to be making their ways in different directions.
- Upon a couple of the seats 3x single blue gems can be found.

## 5: The Mirror (Pond)

- A sign highlights a place called the mirror. It is a crystal clear pond, with what appears to be mirrored tiles under the water.
- A young woman sits upon the edge, her feet dangling in. She appears to be reflecting on some of her life choices. Observers will hear her say:
  - I killed him, i killed my father. Well he always put me down, belittled my choices.
  - And that bitch of a wife of his, she wasn't even my real mother. She had it coming.
  - Yes, im pleased to be rid of them.
  - Then my boyfriend, what was he doing, he shouldn't have seen me, he shouldn't have been there. He wouldn't have understood. I only meant to warn him. But the arrow called to me, and it was one hell of a shot. Through two open windows and straight to the heart, at least I honoured him with a quick death.
  - He fared better than my sister, she has always been the pretty one, she was always the favourite. She started to cry as i made the first cut. She screamed by the second. Im not sure at what point she died. But after removing her face, i assure you she wont have an open casket.
  - Now here I sit, the edge of reflection, the day before my own death. I have many regrets, but the only one i have, is that i didnt do it sooner.
- Just bobbing along the surface of the water, radiating out from her feet, one blue and two red orbs begin floating to the centre of the pond.

## 6: Botanical Room

- The plants in here are overgrown and wild. There is nothing of note here, all standard botanicals. It would appear to be currently set up as a training room for new aspiring gardeners. Although judging by the state of the room, it is not fit for purpose at all and would take weeks to prune back to a normal level.

## 7: Billiard Room

- In the centre of the room is is a off snooker table, it is at a slightly off angle. Whilst it is not super off putting, it is just enough to make things slightly uncomfortable.
- You notice the traditional red coloured balls are racked up in the triangle ready for a break.
- A closer inspection will find that the centre red is actually a large red orb (Roll Advantage)

## 8: Dreamers Tavern

- From a distance you can hear the sound of breaking glass and flying bottles. You also hear screaming and shouting coming from the bar.
- As you reach the door it all falls silent. As you walk in you notice it has been the scene of a violent bar fight. So recent in fact you can just witness the last of the dreamers disappear from the plane in a cloud of black dust.
- The sign seems to indicate a lot of vintages you recognise, at prices multiple times higher than it should be for such ‘sub par’ quality. You wouldnt be shocked if this wasnt the cause of the brawl in the first place.
- You can find a single red orb, as well as a single blue in here.

## 9: The Library

- The room is set up as a library, the books have interesting titles, but all appear blank inside.
- You witness a dreamer pick up a book from the shelf and walk to the chair before taking a seat and opening it. The book appears to magically populate as he turns each page.
- You would hope to glean some interesting knowledge from the books. That is, until you realised its talking about crop rotation in the year 700DR, and how things have changed over the past 600 years.

## 10: Main Theatre

- This is a place of wonder, and whilst at the moment it is set up for an opera, the theatre is able to dynamically change for any and all stage productions. The dreamer is able to shape the world to be what ever it needs to be.
- At the moment there would appear to be a dreamer standing upon the stage with a white masquerade mask on a stick covering the left half of their face. They appear to be well dressed singing of a phantom of sorts. The tune is unfamiliar to you, but you imagine somewhere it is probably incredibly popular.
- Whilst they dreamer appears to be giving a fair performance, the room itself is entirely empty. That does not seem to be stopping the dreamer who appears to be attempting some form of ‘call and answer’ with the crowd and is egging the crowd on.
- The Main Theatre also appears to have seen better days. Many of the seats have torn covers, with a few having actually been ripped from the floor and thrown across the room. One of the balconies appears to have collapse.
- A look at the ceiling will also reveal that part of it has in fact come down and destroyed the right most stairs. Lucienne said the dream plane was crumbling, this isnt necessarily what you were expecting.
- You can find up to 12 orbs, mostly red.

## 11: Boxes

- Scattered around the theatre are the boxes, each one is simple with seats and a set of viewing binoculars.
- To the right and left are the entertainment boxes.
  - The left is the dining area, food can be found on the tables and there are several dreamers here in masquerade masks and dinner attire.
  - The right is a more simpler room with an automated machine in the centre for rolling, cutting and lighting of cigars.

## 12: Workshop

- These rooms all link together and range from places for people to get ready for their performances, play writes to prepare and set designers and builders to construct great scenes.
- These rooms all seem to be a hive of activity with dreamers preparing different parts of their respective shows.

## 13: Amusement Park

- An amazing chance to get away from things is the amusement park, which contains a variety of standard fare ground attractions. Sadly however there is little of it left. It has almost entirely been destroyed.
- From what you can tell, one of the great spires from the theatre of dreams itself had collapsed destroying the amusement park with it. There are 6 orbs here, each one around the rubble. You imagine these dream orbs were dropped a little prematurely, much like that spire.

## 14: Ship

- The ship appears to be being manned by a crew of dreamers, with a captain who clearly has a thing for shouting.
- The ship is little more than a practise ship you might find for children to play near a harbour. But the captain appears to be working the crew as if they were sailing into the very centre of a maelstrom.

## 15: The Labyrinth Of The Eternals

- There is a tall hedge maze, although in the centre appears to be a tall tree blowing in the wind. There also appears to be a strange sound coming from the centre.
