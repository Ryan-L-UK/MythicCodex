Until the spell ends, whenever a creature other than you comes within 30 feet of the ammunition for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, one piece of ammunition flies up to strike it. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take {@damage 1d6} piercing damage. The piece of ammunition is then destroyed. The spell ends when no ammunition remains.",
