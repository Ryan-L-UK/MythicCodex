    "A creature that partakes of the feast gains several benefits. The creature is cured of all diseases and poison, becomes immune to poison and being {@condition frightened}, and makes all Wisdom saving throws with advantage. Its hit point maximum also increases by {@dice 2d10}, and it gains the same number of hit points. These benefits last for 24 hours."
