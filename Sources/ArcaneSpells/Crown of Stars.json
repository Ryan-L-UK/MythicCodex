    "Seven star-like motes of light appear and orbit your head until the spell ends. You can use a bonus action to send one of the motes streaking toward one creature or object within 120 feet of you. When you do so, make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 4d12} radiant damage. Whether you hit or miss, the mote is expended. The spell ends early if you expend the last mote.",
