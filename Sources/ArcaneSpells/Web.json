    "You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are {@quickref difficult terrain||3} and lightly obscure their area.",
    "If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.",
    "Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is {@condition restrained} as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.",
    "A creature {@condition restrained} by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer {@condition restrained}.",
    "The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing {@damage 2d4} fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire."
