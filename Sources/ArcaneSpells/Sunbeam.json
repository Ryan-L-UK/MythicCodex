    "A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 6d8} radiant damage and is {@condition blinded} until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition blinded} by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.",

    "For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight."
