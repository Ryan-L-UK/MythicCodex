    "A tendril of inky darkness reaches out from you, touching a creature you can see within range to drain life from it. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes {@damage 2d8} necrotic damage, and the spell ends. On a failed save, the target takes {@damage 4d8} necrotic damage, and until the spell ends, you can use your action on each of your turns to automatically deal {@damage 4d8} necrotic damage to the target. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else, if the target is ever outside the spell's range, or if the target has total cover from you.",
