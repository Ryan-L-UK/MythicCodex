# The Old Lighthouse

## General Notes

Pointing out into the bay, on a rugged spit of land known as Fang Point, the old lighthouse of Gullet Cove is a familiar feature to many sailors who make port their home. Its role is vital, the coast around Gullet Cove is treacherous and there are numerous patches of submerged rocks. In the past, ships were lured onto these rocks, deliberately wrecked, and then pillaged by the Gullet Cove smugglers and pirates. In these more civilised times, Fang Point guides ships into the harbour where they can be pillaged by legal, if no less ruthless, means. Fang Point Lighthouse is relatively new. It was built approximately fifty years ago, after the previous lighthouse collapsed.

It is a solid, well-kept tower with a large, magically powered lamp in its peak. The lamp itself is a marvel of dwarven engineering. Shaped into the likeness of four tiger heads, light blazes forth from their maws, teeth bared and roaring across the bay. It is one of the first things most visitors to Gullet Cove see, and one of the last things they forget.

## Creatures/NPCs

The Lighthouse is crewed by three keepers:

- **Migran** a dwarf with a serious attitude problem.
- **Ginger Mick** a bobtail cat who has worked the lighthouse for so long, any single thing said by anyone is a joke and must be laughed at. When an actual joke is told however, he will remain completely straight faced and will often ask what is wrong with the joke teller.
- **Grion Whistle** A grizzled, white-haired veteran of a decade of hard sailing. Grion has no time, no patients and virtually no manners.

## Area Information

The lighthouse is reliable, which, as the sailors say, is all it damn well needs to be. All three of the keepers are experienced, committed, and usually to be found smoking a pipe (even Ginger Mick...especially Ginger Mick) or sipping from a flask (bowl) filled with rum. The three speak relatively little but they see every ship heading into Gullet Cove...always useful information for those willing to invest time into winning their confidence.
