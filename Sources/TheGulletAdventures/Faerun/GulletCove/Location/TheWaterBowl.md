# The Temple Of Virtuous Probability

The Water Bowl is a well-kept tavern with just enough frills and rough edges to make most feel comfortable. The dining room has a bar and several tables, enough to comfortably hold up to 30. The morning meal here is a pleasant combination of bread and honey mixed with cinnamon. A handful of commoners are here eating breakfast.

Between the outside light through the open windows or the green driftglobe over the bar, the dining room is brightly lit.

Duric Green the owner of the inn tends the bar.
