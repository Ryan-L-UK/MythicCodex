# Waukeens Promenade

## General Notes

You wander through the streets of Gullet Cove, and come across the market, which is located in the very centre of town. It seems that the vendors are organised by raw materials and commodities on one half of the market, finished products on the other half. The market is known for being a pretty rough and tumble place, and is astonishingly well-kempt. The most important thing about the market is no two days are the same, so expect the venders and their wares to change regularly.

The merchants of the town are a proud people and take pride in their wares. Be warned that whilst bartering is certainly encouraged, some merchants won’t take kindly to the suggestion their wares are sub-standard.

## Feywild Circus

As you step through a tent opening you feel the air around you crackles with vibrant energy, and the familiar world you knew transforms into a whimsical spectacle. You find yourself in a vast, enchanted clearing within the Feywild—a realm where magic and nature intertwine seamlessly. All around you, the air is filled with the scents of wildflowers and the faint sound of ethereal music.

Golden lanterns hang from the tent's entrance, casting a warm, enchanting glow upon the scene. Along the cobblestone pathway more golden lanturns hang from streetlights. Despite appearing small from the outside, the tent feels larger on the inside, and the top of the tent appears bewitched like a night sky. Along either side of the cobblestone path way lie stands, small tents, games and amusements. It is a mesmerizing sight, a bustling kaleidoscopic world of wonders. The air is filled with the fragrance of freshly popped corn and spun sugar.

Fey creatures of all shapes and sizes, dressed in flamboyant attire, roam about, displaying an array of enchanting talents. Acrobats gracefully twirl and soar through the air, their movements defying gravity. Fire dancers spin flames around themselves, the flickering light casting enchanting shadows.

In one corner, a mischievous satyr plays a lively tune on his pipes, coaxing even the most reserved patrons to dance with wild abandon. On another stage, a troupe of magical animals—glowing butterflies, shimmering unicorns, and mischievous pixies—perform an intricate dance, their movements synchronizing with the rhythmic beats of an unseen drummer.

A booth nearby houses a variety of magical curiosities, each whispering tales of their extraordinary properties. Glimmering crystals, captured sparks of starlight, and peculiar potions that promise fantastical transformations are among the offerings.

The scents of delicious treats waft through the air, enticing you to explore further. Fey vendors sell delectable goodies, such as candied moonberries, enchanted caramel apples that shimmer with stardust, and sweet nectar drinks that sparkle like liquid gemstones.

Throughout the circus, mischievous sprites dart among the crowd, playfully pulling pranks and casting minor illusions to add an extra touch of magic to the experience. The atmosphere is one of enchantment and revelry, where the boundaries between performer and spectator blur, and everyone is invited to join in the festivities.

As you immerse yourself in the Feywild circus, you can't help but feel the palpable sense of wonder and the undeniable magic that permeates every aspect of this extraordinary realm.

## The Copper Pitcher

Owned by Oakie Thompson and Mokie Thompson; a pair of twin spaniels who finish each others sentences. The Copper Pitcher is a bric-a-brac stand, with dozens of different items all in differing states of disrepair. There is seldom anything of real value here, but occasionally they have been known to stumble upon the odd random magical item. Although they would never know its worth unless someone told them.

## The Elven Pastry Kitchen

This bakeshop is known for baking rolls in the shapes of various small animals. There is a fair skinned adorably short halfling, Seraphina Stoutbridge.

## The Futures Nigh

The hooded cloaked fortune-teller uses divination magic to predict the future and tell your fortune. How true it is, depends on how much you would like to read into it, but plenty of people seem to visit her. Each reading will set you back 15sp.

## Hometown Hook

Run by a renown fisher of Gullet Cove, Brume Copperwelt. This oversized fish stall is always well stocked with the fresh catch of the day. A halfling with unrivalled ambition, Brume has a fleet of small finishing vessels that work for him, and his stock truly is of the finest quality.

Brume himself is a simple halfling with a huge belly and a pipe never out of his lips. His stall is one of a kind with a revolutionary cooling system designed by Timorey.

| Item           | Cost | Description                                                                                                                         |
| :------------- | :--: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trout          | 5cp  | Appearing good quality, some of the trout have a small rainbow streak down their side.                                              |
| Catfish        | 8cp  | An oversized catfish, its price is certainly fair. Beside it, catfish cavear can also be bought by the cup.                         |
| Catfish Cavear | 4cp  | A subtle flavour, the cavear is good, and given its origin, much cheaper than the sturgen variety.                                  |
| Quipper        | 2sp  | With sharp teeth, this piranha type fish would certainly pack a bite. The fish on display looks delicious.                          |
| Mako Shark     | 1gp  | With only the fin for sale, anything from a shark will always carry a heavy price tag. Similar to tuna, this is a fine cut of fish. |
| Bream          | 1sp  | A small fish, the breams scales shine in the sun. There are not many left, seems like its been a good seller today.                 |
| Sprats         | 2cp  | This small fish serves as little more than a quick snack. Smoked with both oak and maple wood, the flavour is exceptional.          |

## Nip & Tuck

Sharing a stand with Smell My Posy, the speciality team of Nip & Tuck specialise in legal drugs and narcotics. They have previously falling foul of the tainted catnip and anise, however not any more. Taking care to source their stock direct from the ships, and only in sealed containers, it would seem they have learned their lesson.

| Item               | Cost | Description                                                                             |
| :----------------- | :--: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Catnip Pouch (x1)  | 27sp | A small pouch of good quality catnip.                                                   |
| Catnip Pouch (x10) | 22gp | An oversized pouch of good quality catnip.                                              |
| Anise Pouch (x1)   | 34sp | A small pouch of good quality anise.                                                    |
| Anise Pouch (x10)  | 29gp | An oversized pouch of good quality anise.                                               |
| Home Blend (x2)    | 8gp  | The home blend is a special combination of both anise and catnip, designed for couples. |
| Moss Cove Tobacco  | 8gp  | A local batch of tobacco, it is best smoked in a pipe. The longer the stem the better.  |

## Nights Brooch

Owned by Felicity Flop, a tiny cat who tinkles when she moves, her ginger fur braided with dozens of gems. The Nights Brooch is a small, mobile cart selling jewellery, particularly pearls pressed into seashells. She herself is nice enough, but her wares are somewhat questionable.

| Item                | Cost | Description                                                                                                              |
| :------------------ | :--: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ruby Ring           | 3gp  | This ring looks like its full of potential, but is little more than a regular ruby ring. It does at least fit well.      |
| Pearl Neckless      | 2gp  | the pearls on this chain are at least real, but the name has generated some laughing from the towns folk.                |
| Glass Gem           | 4gp  | A fine cut piece of glass, an unsuspecting townsfolk would be forgiven for thinking this is real.                        |
| The Dream Diamond   | 10gp | The ‘Dream Diamond’ is aptly named, as you must be dreaming if you think its a diamond, and downright insane to buy it.  |
| Ring of Free Action | 5gp  | The band is a collectionf of silver chainlinks with a blue rectangular cut gem in the centre. It certainly looks pretty. |
| Waterdeep Sapphire  | 2gp  | There are a collection of Sapphires on the table in various sizes and qualities. One of the few gems here that are real! |

## Smell My Posy

Owned by McIvor Glistenhame, a half-elf with a constant frown of concentration. Smell My Posy is a small flower stand, with artfully arranged bouquets of roses, delicately laced with dried seaweed. She also has a stock of various plants and seeds, but most of them are little more than decorative items.

| Item           | Cost | Description                                                                                             |
| :------------- | :--: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bellrue        | 5cp  | It is a weed, it has large flowers and in songs it is associated with a city.                           |
| Bronzeleaf     | 8cp  | It is a small plant, it has green flowers and it is commonly used in broths.                            |
| Laketongue     | 4cp  | It is a sweet-smelling cactus, it has bulbous capsules and it’s roots are used as a cure for headaches. |
| Dragon-Blossom | 2sp  | It is a beautiful plant, it has small berries and it can be made into a potent soup.                    |
| Bane Cherry    | 1gp  | It is a grass, it has copper flowers and it is best boiled.                                             |
