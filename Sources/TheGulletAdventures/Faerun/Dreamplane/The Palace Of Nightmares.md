# The Palace Of Nightmares

---

## The Dragon Room (B2F)

- The smell of brimstone is much higher here, it a strong and unpleasant smell. Its also disturbingly hot.
- Laying on the floor systematically heating a large boiler chamber can be found a Rainbow Dragon called [Aldryrth, The Rainbow Heart](https://www.notion.so/Aldryrth-The-Rainbow-Heart-247c3bdf0e944560a654e9b4045294dc)
- Aldryrth has been promised freedom from the celestial plane, wealth, gold, treasures and the freedom to dominate the lands of Faerun. To achieve this she need but do her part in powering the machine. She is less pleased of this prospect of being trapped down here, but the ends justify the means. (See section on Prince of Nightmares)
- Aldryrth can be convince to go against the Prince with the right information and motivation and as a trinket for their favour will offer a small vial of her blood. ‣
- If convinced Aldryrth will break free from the basement destroying the citadel in the process, smashing through the upper floors and wall to escape. The citadel will go on the defensive to try and take the dragon down. The party may elect to use this as a moment to strike.

## The Machine Room (B1F)

- This is the main machine room it is responsible for powering the various turbines and fans which will propel the citadel into the air.
- The noise is loud of the sound of incredibly heavy gears meshing together. The smell of brimstone and sulfer is a little stronger from here, but it still smells like its coming from below you.
- You can see a small room with a bed in it. You imagine there should be a worker or dreamer of some kind here manning this, but it would appear no one is around. Some of the pathways to the gears are a little precarious, so it is plausible the previous dream fell, or possible was pushed in.
- The opposite side of the room there is a large terminal. It has a giant magical display with a 3:00 on it (3 minutes), as well as a series of 9 buttons in front of them arranged in a 3x3 grid. There is also a giant red button which reads ‘initiate Shutdown’
- When any are pressed, the X upon the button lights up red. The goal is for them to place 6 X’s within the grid without creating a line of 3 in any direction. They have 3 minutes to do this before a construct drone is sent out to attack them and the clock resets. They will be only given the instructions when they press start and the three minute timer begins.

Once they have completed this, the machine will shut down. The machine if in flight will begin to decent, potentially with cataclysmic effects. If the machine is yet to take off, it will now be unable to.

## Servants Quarters (1F) - Entrance

- The party will enter on this level and find a various dreamers being subjected the nightmares by having to work and toil in kitchens.
- As you walk through the door you find a variety of armour statues in front of you. The metal of each appears to be a blackened steel. Although a closer inspection reveals that this is little more than decorative armour. It serves no purpose and you are even able to bend it with your own hands.
- There is a sign upon the door which reads in a mix of languages. ‘Dreamers Torment’.
- The conditions will be poor, and a demon will be there to oversee them. A glance at them will suggest that several of these dreamers would appear to have been here for some time. Perhaps not in one go, but certainly enough stints to know their way around.
- You actually notice the face of a dwarf you recognise. [The Cunning Man](https://www.notion.so/The-Cunning-Man-3da91f7ecdd74125b1bbdaf3bf311783)
  - You will find him in the corner of a room crying and whimpering. He would appear to be holding his chest still. It would seem despite this being a dream and ones mental projection. What ever caused this injury seems to have made itself here too.
  - A demon can be seen nearby just laughing whilst sat upon a barrel.
  - The cunning man, for the first time actually looks like a genuine person plagued by a life of poor decisions. Although that could just be the pain talking, its hard to say for sure.
- The party will find {2x D8} worth of nightmare crystals around the room, but in general there are not items of interest in this, the servants and cooks level.
- Stairwells can be found in each corner going both up and down. From upstairs you can hear what sounds like 4 sequential explosions, from below you hear a loud mechanical drone, most likely from large machinery.

## Imperial Guards Quarters (2F)

- This area is a bustle of activity, and sequential explosions. The sign on the door reads ‘Imperial Guards Quarters’
- Inside you can find a simple bed chamber, that given where it is situated is surprisingly soundproof. If the party attempt to go in, one will hiss in draconic to shut the door. In doing so the room will fall mostly silent. There would appear to be some form of magical enchantment going on.
- The room itself will be simple and there are no material possessions here, and as this is the crew, there are no real dreamers allowed on this level.
- They will find a collection of Dryad Artificers helping with the cannons which are operated magically. In theory it would be possible to launch someone out of the canon. But without some very careful use of spells, they will be turned into a small pool of what used to be sentient mater.
- The canons fire one after another in a sequential fashion.
- As we are in the dream lands there will be the odd nightmare and dream stone, but mostly it will be clear of them.

## The Princes Treasure Room (3F)

A place of boasting, the Princes’ treasure room hosts 5 main rooms of interest

### The Plagued Gardens

- The plagued gardens are full of a variety of plants, none of which have any labels and all look terrifying.
  - You can recognise the stem of a ‣
  - **The Phantom Floweror Mirage Flower** is able to project dozens of ghostly copies of itself in order to fool creatures that wish to harm the plant. It is a useful ingredient in many potions, but its unique ability makes it frustrating to harvest.
  - **The Claymore Mushroom:** is a mushroom that explodes when you step on it. This has been raised and surrounded by glass.
  - **Ripplebark:** Bracket fungus that resembles rotting flesh. It is edible and tastes good roasted.
- You also fear that several of the plants may be moving with you in the room. This is the plagued garden after all, contained within a dream world, you would expect things to not be as they seem.

### The Observation Room

- This room has a few notes written, but whilst the ink is fresh, the words are old. It appears to be in reference a blend of things ranging from:
  - Old book passages
  - Historical events, one that is referenced several times is something called: [The Spellplague](https://www.notion.so/The-Spellplague-d65efe627d7b403ebc748c25978e332b)
  - What you assume are the dreams/nightmares of others.
- It would appear that each reference has a variety of bridging notes clearly linking them together. But you would need to know about each point in depth to decipher the true meaning of these note. It is less of memoirs or plans, and more a brain dump of ideas and notes that link to them to one another.
- There is also a bottle of black tar-like liquid, with a used shot glass beside it. There would appear to be 3 or 4 shots worth of liquid inside the unlabelled bottle. Consumption of this will immediately cause the drinker to black out for 1 real time minute.

### The Menagerie

- Once containing great and exciting birds and animals, you imaging this would have been a nice place. All that remains inside however is a strong smell of death, the caracasses of rotting animals, and a single rather haggard looking Macaw. You imagine he was blue once, but at this point he is a blend of scarlet and black.
- You are not sure what caused him to turn ferrall, but its safe to say you want no part in it.
- His water is foul and black, you are not sure if something has been mixed with it, but you certainly know better from the smell than to drink it.
  - Consumption of the liquid will result in a sudden desire to want to eat something. It doesnt matter what it is, food, object or person. All that is on the forefront of your mind is to eat something, and to do so quickly. You fear for what might happen if you don’t quench this desire fast.

### Relics & Treasures

- The books appear to be a mix of nightmare related content. It is hard to say if these are nightmares inflicted, or nightmares planned. Needless to say some of the stuff within is harrowing. Even in the dream world you wouldnt wish this any anyone.
- Potions
  - Elixir of Dubious Augmentation: for 24 hours, the values of your lowest ability score and your highest ability score are swapped, ties determined by the DM.
  - The Dragons Bite: Picture of a Dragon on the bottle and it is a crimson red. The potion turns the user into a kobold for 24 hours.
  - ‣ is pride of place on the shelf.
- The centrepiece is a single angel wing, which has been placed behind a multi-inch thick pane of glass. It would be possible to get through the glass, but heaven knows you would need to hit it hard, with something incredibly big.

### Amusements

- The amusment room contains a variety of terrifying masks, as well as devices of torture. You can get the impression from looking at the room, dreamers are brought here and abused. You know from your experience of the world, abuse comes in many forms, and its safe to say ALL forms of abuse have probably taken place in this room at one point or another.
- For now however the room appears covered in a light dust, as if not used for a while.

## Throne Room (4F)

The main throne room is divided into a few sections.

### Bedchambers

This is the main place of sleep and is ornate. More of the various scribbling can be found along with more bottles of the curious black liquid.

- This is the room where the prince of nightmare comes to unwind. There is no clear evidence that he has ever slept here.
  - A high perception check will highlight a single blue orb under the bed. It would appear that perhaps he has once dreamed a happy dream in this place. You wonder what someone like this could dream about. Someone who is clearly full of so much evil.
- A chest can be found, with loads of orbs in it, each one is clear however. It would appear these are empties attempted to have been stashed away. You are not sure how they have been emptied or why, but your guess is that its something to do with this curious black liquid he drinks.

### Throne Room

The throne room is elaborate, but you expected nothing less. The carpet long, red and blood stained. The golden chair ornate and covered in a mix of spikes, swords and golden skulls. The material that makes the seat appears blackened and well worn. The plants to each side appear dead or dying. But its hard to tell if thats just the type of plant they are, or if its the negligence of being around the prince of nightmares that has caused this.

### Map Room

This giant table is in the process of being constructed and it would appear that is shows a map of the entrance from the celestial plane, a map of the plane of dreams and an area that is marked for Faerun. There are two dryads in here acting as cartographers drawing.
