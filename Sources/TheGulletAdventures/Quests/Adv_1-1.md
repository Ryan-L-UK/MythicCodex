# A Gullet Cove Hello

## Welcome To The City

Read:

> The wind is strong and the scent of the sea which has filled your nostrils for weeks is slowly replaced by a much less pleasant odour. The town of Gullet Cove stands before you, and before you even set foot on the shore you can hear the shouts of street-traders, the roar of drunken sailors celebrating arriving home, and the haggling of merchants already negotiating the price of newly arrived produce. You’re finally here. Time to start exploring!

- Leaving the ship characters are free to wander off in any direction they see fit. There are a variety of things going on around the docks.
- After a short time a fight will break out between a dog, a cat and two humans. This will be the first interaction with the townsfolk and will reveal that there is a touch of racism. Even if the fight was actually caused by a cat called [Eduardo].
- During this one of the characters with the highest initiative DC will notice they are being robbed by a small mangy cat called [Juseff]. He will run off towards an alley, but he isnt too worried about getting caught. A Dex Save (DC16) is needed to catch him.

## The Cradles Employment

- The cradle are one of the older guilds in the region and a cat focussed guild.
- The head of the cradle will explain that someone has broken into the store of one of their members, Master Pettifer’s Emporium and that they have attempted to frame the cradle for their wrong doing.
- He will offer a pretty sizeable reward of 200gp each for the completion of the task.
- They will disappear into the shadows and will offer [Juseff]’s help if the party want it. Although he really doesnt have much to offer in that regard.

## Master Pettifer’s Emporium

- Upon arriving at the ship they will find that there is a variety of broken glass inside and the place is a bit of a mess. Inside will be [Master Pettifer] & [Rufus] attempting to clean the mess. The shop is always somewhat of a mess, but this is something else.
- Three of his items, and a small pouch of gold 30gp will have been stolen.
- A search within the shop will reveal a set of boot prints, as well as some string on the jagged glass.
- Whilst both will be keen to help find the missing items, neither of them will be particularly happy about speaking to the new arrivals.
- The Watch House have been informed of the break in, however they are renoun for not being that good with ‘gang crimes’. They are too focused on other issues.

# The Masters Retreat

## Inside The Inn

- Arriving at The Masters Retreat will reveal a pretty run down place, with a strong dislike for any animal that is awoken. Patrons will tut and spit at any animal who gets too close to them.
- The barman will be less than forthcoming with any information.
- With an investigation check (DC14), players can find a trapdoor to the cellar hidden underneath a table in the room off to the side. It would require stealth to enter without detection.
- There is also a beer garden where Swindell & Buller can be found, discussing with 3 goblins about the plans for the Cunning Man.

## The Cellar

- Upon entering the cellar players will note that it is a relatively simple hole underneath the tavern.
- Downstairs they will find a few empty crates in a variety of sizes. They will have traces of animal hair inside with the a high investigation check.
- There will also be shreds of paper around the floor. They have a variety of nail marks through them suggested they have been pinned and removed multiple times. The pages also show multiple names. A nature check will reveal these are actually breeds and species of animal and these were the name tags on the cages.

## The Garden

- The garden is quite simple, little more than a few picnic benches surrounded by a tall, 7ft high wall.
- Sitting at one bench, two humans can be found, [Swindel] & [Buller]. Close by on a second table can be found 3x [Goblins] who are just sitting listening to them discuss.
- If they detect anyone, roll for initiative and a fight will break out. Both Swindel & Buller will attempt to surrender, if they are given the chance to, depending how blood thirsty the party are.
- Once defeated the inn will erupt into chaos. Now that Swindel & Buller are dead, it would seem the patrons no longer care about the place and are robbing it blind.
- On the bodies the following can be found:
  - Money Pouch (30gp)
  - Money Pouch (20gp)
  - Receipt ‘Timorys Shipyard Wonders’
  - Badly Written Note, from CM.

## Back Inside

- The inn has emptied, leaving behind a pile of broken glass. It would appear more than just the ones thrown at Elvis. Clearly several fights took place, the tables are over turned.
- The cash register has been emptied and most of the strong alcohol has been taken. Word travels fast that Swindel and Buller have died. There are no patrons at all, and no one will arrive, its clear that the place is now ‘shut’.

# Items Lost and Found

## Timorys Shipyard Wonders

- Timorys Shipyard Wonders honestly looks like a junk yard. A look around the place will reveal a variety of half started and poorly finished projects.
- It is also clear to see that [Timory] clearly keeps things close to his chest and a variety of the projects have got large sheets to cover them away from prying eyes.
- The items stolen from Master Pettifers were deemed useless and have been sold on to Timory, who will be more than willing to sell them back, for a fair profit in his mind. The current asking price is double their original sold value on the receipt.
  - Handsized Chest (10GP – 20GP)
  - Teeth of The Kraken (5GP – 10GP)
  - Eyes Of Longing (5GP – 10GP)

## Master Pettifer’s Emporium

- Master Pettifer will be surprisingly grateful that they are party have returned. He will also comment on the speed at which they have achieved the result. Given his experience with The Watch, he will be very happy. Well, at least as happy as he gets…
- A reward of the following will be provided:
  - A small money pouch with 6gp.
  - If all 3 items a returned, he will offer them one free of charge. He will however offer no explanation as of what they do.

# The Reward

## The Cradle

- Approaching the safehouse to claim your reward, a severe lack of movement will be noticed. Previously there were signs of life, but now there is nothing. The cradle themselves appear to have moved on from this safehouse for now, relocating to a new and undisclosed location.
- A hidden sign will be found painted on the wall, which will advise that the cradle will be found when they are needed. Until then however, thank you for your work.

## The Scratch Post

- The scratching post is full of patrons, and is surprisingly busy for the season and time of year. A few people are discussing an event tomorrow, although its not evidently clear what that is.
- There will be some additional pouches of money given to each person they will not find until the morning. There will also be an entire Ham Hock, as well as a tray of a new form of catnip placed on the table for the players enjoyment.
- Overnight there will be some crashing and banging from many streets away, it doesn’t sound harrowing but does wake you a couple of times. (doesn’t impact long rest)

## Level Up

- Characters should advance from level 1, to level 2.
