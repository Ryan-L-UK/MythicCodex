# Written in Blood

## Background

Every year, the Awakening Festival draws folk from across the Moonshae Isles, uniting celebrants as they tell their history in song and set the course for the upcoming year. But the mood turns grim when a group of farmers suddenly turns violent, manipulated by an unknown magical malady. In the aftermath, well-known trader **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt%20Dellie.png)** fears for her goddaughter **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)**, a worker at the farm the attackers came from, deep within the outlying farmlands known as Ulgoth's Beard. When the characters investigate, they are pitted against a lurking evil that uses a young woman's grief and loneliness to lure new victims.

# Part 1: Starting the Adventure

The adventure begins following the characters downtime, they have elected to meet this morning and they may wish to share stories of their downtime. Today is the start of the Awakening Festive, A Day to celebrate a retelling of the land of Faerûn history, with a focus on the animal awakenings.

> You all awaken this morning having had 15 days to yourself. You agreed to meet today as it is the first of a multiday event called the 'Awakening Festival'. This festival is only generally celebrated on Moonshae Isles, although a small number of folks on the mainland have been known to recognise the days significance. This annual celebration is marked by the multiday _Awakening Song_, a communal retelling of the land's history and a memorial to those who've passed on. Drawing particular attention to the history of awakened animals.
>
> You meet this morning in Waukeen's Promenade, where preparations are very much already underway. The streets are alive with vibrant music. As the history of the land is recounted through song, with a variety of musicians and bards coming together to form impromptu bands. Their performances blend together as passers-by join in during choruses, which gives a true sense of collective celebration.

Anyone on the streets of Gullet Cove during the Awakening Festival hears what the locals call the _Awakening Song_, a collection of songs recounting local histories. Characters who spend an hour exploring the festival learn much about the history of the land. They also have advantage on Intelligence (History) checks related to the _Awakening Song_ made for the rest of the adventure.

During the festival, stalls throughout the community sell local crafts, (cheap) musical instruments, and street foods. Small straw dolls wearing colourful shirts and dresses are widely available for 5 cp each. A doll can be made to resemble the buyer for 7 cp. The dolls are a popular local craft and nothing more.

## Eyes of Blood

![Bloody Eyed Farmers](http://localhost:8080/Sources/TheGulletAdventures/Quests/AdvAssets/Adv%204.6%20img1.webp)

After the characters have engaged with the local festival as much as they please, the character who has the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score notices a group of celebrants acting strangely. Read or paraphrase the following:

> As part of the crowd begins another verse of the _Awakening Song_, four what appear to be farmers begin to walk into the area, however rather than singing, they stare blankly. A few moments go by before they surge forward into the celebrants, raising rusty farming implements.

Four farmers attack the festival-goers. They use the **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Cultist.png)** stat block; their rusty, bladed farming implements have the same statistics as scimitars. Any character who engages the farmers sees their eyes swirl with crimson, resembling bloody, unshed teardrops. Characters have no way of knowing it yet, but this is a mark of the soul shaker's control (see the "Soul Shaker" section at the end of this adventure).

The festival-goers closest to the strange farmers panic and flee. Unless the characters do the same, the attackers target them.

Only one local holds their ground: a surprised woman named **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt%20Dellie.png)** (**[Commoner](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Commoner.png)**). She clearly recognizes some of the strange farmers and tries to reason with them to no avail. **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt%20Dellie.png)** shouts for the characters not to kill the farmers, noting that they're not behaving like themselves.

## Memories of Death

When the last **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Farmer.png)** is defeated, locals return to tend to the wounded. The farmers are known to many in the crowd, prompting confusion over their strange appearance and what caused them to attack. Talk of curses begins to spread.

**_Investigating the Farmers._** A character who fought the farmers or examines them afterward can make a DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check. On a success, the character can tell the farmers are being magically controlled. Spells like _[Detect Magic](http://localhost:8080/Sources/ArcaneSpells/Detect%20Magic.png)_ also reveal that the farmers are surrounded by an aura of enchantment magic. While this magic—the effects of the soul shaker's _[Geas](http://localhost:8080/Sources/ArcaneSpells/Geas.png)_ spell—lingers, the farmers' eyes keep their crimson hue.

If the farmers are healed or roused from unconsciousness, they refuse to speak. They don't attack again, but the locals keep them restrained.

The characters likely don't have the resources to remove the enchantment affecting the farmers yet—only destroying the soul shaker or waiting approximately a month can do this. Even if the characters do remove the effect, the farmers are confused and remember nothing helpful.

**_Strange Parchment._** As the characters investigate the situation, **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt%20Dellie.png)** notices that one of the farmers was clutching a crumpled sheet of parchment. She opens it, and nearby characters hear her curse in concerned shock. **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt%20Dellie.png)** hands the crumpled parchment to any character who asks about it. It bears a charcoal sketch of a child struggling to swim in dark water while being grasped at by hands beneath the surface.

## A Godmother's Fear

**[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt%20Dellie.png)** clearly recognizes the sketch on the parchment one of the strange farmers had with them. Her strong voice shakes as she explains its significance:

- The sketch was drawn by **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt%20Dellie.png)**'s goddaughter, **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)**. **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt%20Dellie.png)** knows her art style, and this is a scene she draws regularly.
- As a child, **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** saw her friend Culley drown in Cradlelace Lake while they were playing.
- Since Culley's death, **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** has used art to work through the sadness and guilt she carries to this day.
- **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** is currently working a farm in Ulgoth's Beard, a half-day's travel from Gullet Cove. She was due to return to town for the Awakening Festival, but **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt%20Dellie.png)** hasn't seen her yet.

Characters who investigate further and ask those nearby about the attack learn that the strange farmers all worked in Ulgoth's Beard, a dangerous but fertile farming region haunted by deadly predators.

While the locals speculate about the fates of other farmers in Ulgoth's Beard, **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt%20Dellie.png)** has no patience for debates on what to do next. **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt%20Dellie.png)** implores the characters to go to Ulgoth's Beard where **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** was working and make sure her goddaughter is safe, while she stays in Gullet Cove to organize a larger investigation. She offers the party 100 gp to undertake this mission, and 100 gp more if the characters return her goddaughter to Gullet Cove safely.

**[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt%20Dellie.png)** gives the characters directions to Ulgoth's Beard, but she doesn't know exactly where **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)**'s farm is. The characters must search for it once they reach Ulgoth's Beard.

# Part 2: To Ulgoth's Beard

The farm **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** works at is 12 miles from Gullet Cove. Whether the characters are traveling by foot or using a wagon, at a normal pace it takes half a day to reach Ulgoth's Beard.

Once the characters are underway, read or paraphrase the following to summarize the journey:

> The journey from Gullet Cove leads south through an area known as the Ribbon, where clustered farmhouses dot the ground on the edge of Dernal Forest. Eventually, the road dwindles to little more than a track. The trees grow denser and the farms fewer and farther between as you near the lands called Ulgoth's Beard. Ulgoth’s Beard sits in a region known as Alaron on the southern edge of the island.

Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) check notices that many of the farms in the Ribbon are touched by blight and the animals are thin. A basic understanding of the region will easy explain that agriculture in the region has been deteriorating for years, forcing locals to farm Ulgoth's Beard despite its dangers.

If the characters stop at any of the farms they pass in the Ribbon, they see no sign of danger, but no one at the farms knows **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)**.

## Last Stop

As the characters push into Ulgoth's Beard, they near a weathered farm surrounded by crops that look healthier than those they saw in the Ribbon. Not everything about the farm is hopeful, though:

> Growls and excited yipping resound from the field surrounding a nearby farm. The source isn't clear, but from the motion of the tall crops, something moves swiftly through the fields parallel to the road.

A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check realizes two groups are moving through the fields, one in pursuit of the other, though the dense crops block their view. Characters who enter the fields find visibility reduced to 10 feet. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Survival) check finds the trail of whatever just moved through the fields and can easily follow it.

### Savage Scavengers

If the characters follow the movement through the field, they come to a clearing and see an old **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Farmer.png)** fleeing three horse-sized coyotes. The **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Farmer.png)** is about 30 feet ahead of the coyotes. If the characters didn't enter the fields, a moment later, an old man stumbles from amid the crops and falls into the road. Three massive coyotes are soon upon him. In either case, the old man has no hope of defending himself against the creatures.

Massive coyotes are a persistent threat in Ulgoth's Beard. The three coyotes use the **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Dire%20Wolf.png)** stat block, while the **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Farmer.png)** they pursue is a **[Commoner](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Commoner.png)**. A coyote flees if reduced to 10 hit points or fewer.

When the fighting ends, the **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Farmer.png)** is bloodied but angrier at the animals than scared. He thanks the characters and introduces himself as Uncle Polder.

### Life in Ulgoth's Beard

Following the battle, Uncle Polder thanks the characters and asks what brings them out this way. He invites them to water their horses and refresh themselves, gesturing to his nearby farm.

Uncle Polder's house is typical of farmhouses in the Ribbon and Ulgoth's Beard, a wood-frame, single-story building with a large porch, bounded by trees. The other farmhouses in the surrounding part of Ulgoth's Beard are all part of the same pact, a communal collection of farms whose inhabitants live, work, and share with each other. Uncle Polder's farmhouse is one of the largest in the group, suggesting his importance to the community.

Uncle Polder is glad to answer any questions the characters have about the area. Use the following points to guide the conversation:

- There's always trouble in Ulgoth's Beard, but Uncle Polder can't recall any unusual problems this season.
- He's met **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** and knows the farm she works at, though it's part of another pact. It's not far from Uncle Polder's, but people in Ulgoth's Beard mostly stick close to home. The farmers of the two pacts don't interact often.
- Uncle Polder recalls helping **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)**'s pact set up early in the season. He keeps an eye out for people who might not be a good fit for life in Ulgoth's Beard, and **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** seemed to have things on her mind other than farming.
- When **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** and others of her pact came to Uncle Polder's pact a couple weeks ago to trade for tools, she seemed to be embracing life in Ulgoth's Beard. She spoke of how happy she was that someone named Culley was coming to join her soon. Uncle Polder assumed Culley was another worker coming late to the farm.

From their conversation with **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt%20Dellie.png)**, the characters remember that Culley was **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)**'s friend who drowned many years ago.

If told the truth about Culley, Uncle Polder is surprised; **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** spoke as if Culley were a close and current friend.

Uncle Polder allows the characters to rest at his home as long as they please. When they're ready to go, he gives them detailed directions to the farm **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** works at a few miles away.

# Part 3: Fallen Farmhouse

![Bloody Eyed Farmers](http://localhost:8080/Sources/TheGulletAdventures/Quests/AdvAssets/Adv%204.6%20img2.webp)

As the characters continue on their journey, they notice the environment changing around them after only another hour of travel. After they've travelled about a mile from Uncle Polder's home, read or paraphrase the following description:

> Moving south through the region you find the small settlement known as Ulgoth’s Beard. Despite being on the edge of the sea, the air here smells stagnant and carries the taste of metal. A small group of farmhouses hunch upon the edge of a patch of green fields.

Suddenly the ground begins to shake, causing the road ahead to ripple, suddenly below you a 10-foot-square, 10-foot-deep sinkhole to opens.

Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 10 feet, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage. Characters who said they would be mindful of sinkholes or unstable ground after the previous tremor have advantage on this saving throw.

Any creature at the bottom of the hole finds they're not alone. Four **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Crawling%20Claws.png)** scrabble free from the dirt at the bottom of the pit and attack any creatures within.

A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) check realizes the tremor likely wasn't an earthquake but something local, such as a collapsing cave or something moving underground. Any character who examines the disembodied hands and succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check can tell that the creatures were digging through the loose earth, though it's not clear to what end.

## X Marks the Spot

The farming community **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** is a part of isn't just one farm, but a cooperative of adjacent farms. As the characters reach the location Uncle Polder directed them to, they find six farmhouses, each in various states of disrepair.

As the characters approach the nearest farm, they find the surrounding fields overgrown and the plants rotting. Crows flit between perches on the fences, but there are no signs of people.

Nearly all the houses have been sloppily painted with a large and muddy red _X_. The interiors of these farmhouses are utilitarian, featuring only a few rooms for sleeping and a small kitchen. No creatures are within, and the accumulation of dust makes it clear no one's disturbed the rooms for some time. Every farmhouse bears a sign that something's wrong. Roll on the Farmhouse Conditions table for each building to determine what.

#### Farmhouse Conditions

| d4  | Condition                                                                                                                                 |
| :-: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | The windows are shattered, and the shards of glass are spattered with dried blood.                                                        |
|  2  | Clothing and belongings are strewn everywhere, all covered in crimson mud.                                                                |
|  3  | Human bones, freshly gnawed by animals, litter the floor of every room.                                                                   |
|  4  | A strange image is painted on the wall in red mud. It depicts either a cluster of arms with no central body or repeating red hand prints. |

A character who investigates at least two of the farmhouses can make a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check. On a success, they notice one farmhouse doesn't have a red _X_ painted on it. This building is the farmhouse where **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** resided, and it also serves as the pact's communal meeting house.

# Part 4: Kianna's Farmhouse

A farmhouse near the center of the steading serves as a main kitchen, dining area, and meeting place for the smaller houses around it. This is the farmhouse where **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** was a resident. As the characters approach, read or paraphrase the following description:

> This large farmhouse appears abandoned like the smaller houses around it, but no _X_ marks it. Farming implements lie abandoned in the mud, and wild plants have grown up to the house's faded wooden porch. The crops in the surrounding field appear sickly.

## Kianna's Farmhouse Locations

![Kianna's Farmhouse Locations](http://localhost:8080/Sources/TheGulletAdventures/Quests/ImageMaps/UlgothsBeard3.1.html)

### F1: Overgrown Yard

The house's yard is muddy red clay. Several rusty shovels and rakes lie scattered about.

**_Farming Implements._** A character who looks around the back of the house sees a pitchfork stuck into the earth near the house's northeast corner. On further investigation, they see it's stuck through the severed hand of a young woman. The characters have no way of knowing this, but the hand was once a crawling claw and was dispatched by a **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Farmer.png)**.

**_Sickly Crops._** Wheat and corn struggle to grow in the fields surrounding the house. Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) check can tell the plants around this farm are sickly because something's wrong with the soil. A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check notices raised paths through the dirt, like mole tunnels, though no creatures are obvious. Although it's not evident, the soul shaker's evil and the excavations of the crawling claws have spoiled the land around the house.

### F2: Porch

A large wooden porch wraps around the front and one side of the farmhouse. Its planks creak ominously when stepped on, but there is no danger here. Closed curtains shroud the windows, but the doors to the interior are unlocked and ajar. Both lead to a musty central hallway.

**_Doors._** The doors leading off the hallway are closed but not locked.

### F3: Living Room

> The furniture in this living room is haphazardly arranged and looks close to falling apart. Beneath, the floor is covered in hundreds of handprints painted using crimson mud.

The art style is similar to that of the picture **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt%20Dellie.png)** found in Promise. Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check notices a break in the pattern under a chair. If the chair is moved, it reveals a muddy depiction of two children—one is reaching for the other, who is being dragged into the water by large hands. Scrapes in the muddy image form the name "Culley."

### F4: Bedroom

The bedroom holds a bed and writing desk for a single occupant. Most of the space is neat and orderly, but the desk is strewn with art supplies and scraps of paper bearing fragmented images.

**_Paintings._** Any character who riffles through the paper on the desk finds repeating images of hands, lakes, and wide eyes looking up through water. The largest work shows a pair of eyes with handprints for pupils. All these images look similar in style to the picture **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt%20Dellie.png)** found in Promise.

**_Chest._** A small chest against the wall is unlocked and holds work clothes sized for a woman. A character who searches the chest and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a pair of overalls with a pocket containing thirteen rings—plain rings, wedding bands, and formal jewelry sized for men and women—worth 2d10 gp each.

### F5: Dining Room

> A long plain table, a wooden sideboard, and several chairs lie shattered on the floor. The debris is streaked with crimson stains.

This dining room has been ransacked, and red mud covers the furnishings and floor.

A character who approaches the table hears scratching coming from under it. Nothing is immediately visible beneath the table, but characters who investigate more closely find six **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Crawling%20Claws.png)** clinging to the underside. Once discovered, the monsters attack.

After the crawling claws are dispatched, any character who searches the room thoroughly can make a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check. On a successful check, the character finds several floorboards that have been pushed up from below, as though the crawling claws dug their way up through the loose soil beneath the house.

### F6: Kitchen

> This kitchen has been torn apart. Pots and pans are scattered everywhere, and rotting food streaks the floorboards.

In the center of the room, four enchanted farmers stand facing each other, their crimson eyes unblinking. Each holds a sharp knife or farming implement. They don't react when the characters enter or if they are touched or spoken to. They react only if harmed, stolen from, or commanded by the soul shaker. Each uses the **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Cultist.png)** stat block. Although the farmers are initially harmless, their appearance and lack of reaction are unnerving.

**_Pantry._** The foodstuffs and supplies that once filled the pantry have been ransacked, and a large cupboard stands open. A trapdoor in the pantry's floor opens to reveal a 10-foot-tall ladder descending into a darkened cold-storage cellar. The stench of something rotting rises from below.

## Cellar Locations

![Cellar Locations](http://localhost:8080/Sources/TheGulletAdventures/Quests/ImageMaps/UlgothsBeard3.2.html)

### F7: Cellar and Tunnel

Shelves bearing root vegetables and other foodstuffs line the walls of this unfinished cellar. The south wall has partially collapsed, revealing a dark, narrow tunnel.

The smell the characters noticed above is worse here, issuing from the tunnel. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher hear the faint sound of a woman singing farther down the tunnel.

Characters who proceed 40 feet into the tunnel see a faint light emanating from around a bend.

**_Tunnel Song._** As the characters move through the tunnel, the song's volume increases. The characters recognize this as part of the Awakening Song they overheard in Promise. This part of the song tells the story of a young man named Culley. Rather than its usual content, where the boy dies by drowning, the song has been sloppily rewritten to feature Culley being saved by his closest friend.

### F8: Cavern

> The tunnel opens into a lantern-lit, packed-dirt chamber, where the cause of the stench becomes apparent. A dozen bodies lie strewn across the floor, all wearing the clothes of farmers. Many of their limbs have been cleanly removed and set into a sizable pile on the far side of the cavern. In the centre of the room, a young woman is singing.

The bodies are the farmers missing from the surrounding farms, save for **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)**. They've been killed and dismembered by the soul shaker.

**_Kianna._** The young woman is **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** (chaotic neutral, human **[Commoner](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Commoner.png)**). She looks like she's in a dream state, and she holds a knife loosely, but her eyes aren't crimson like those of the other farmers. **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** stops singing as soon as she notices the characters and says, "Please go. You shouldn't be here." If the characters speak with **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)**, she drifts between fearfully urging them to leave and coaxing them to stay and meet her friend, Culley, her mood and manner shifting erratically. Use the following points to guide the conversation:

- **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** confirms she's the person the party seeks. She's saddened at any talk of **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt%20Dellie.png)** having sent the characters to find her.
- She speaks brightly of how Culley finally came back to her after she lost him in Cradlelace Lake. It was so good to hear his voice again!
- When **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** heard Culley's voice beyond the cellar, she dug and found this old cavern.
- Something happened to the farmers when they entered the caverns. After that they did whatever Culley said—including hurting one another and marking the houses with _X_'s to note who had visited the cellar.
- If asked about Culley, **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** sadly says her friend drowned long ago—then cheerfully says he didn't drown because she saved him. He went away for a long while, but he came back.
- If asked where Culley is now, **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** fearfully says he's sleeping after having fed. She believes her song helps keep him quiet, but she's tired.

As the characters speak with **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)**, a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check notices **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)**'s eyes darting to the pile of limbs whenever she speaks brightly of Culley.

If the characters ask **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** to leave with them, she seems confused and scared, saying she can't. If she's coerced, or if a character investigates the pile of limbs, the soul shaker awakens.

**_Soul Shaker._** When the characters try to leave the area or disturb the pile of limbs, the heap begins to move, revealing itself as an Undead made entirely of arms and hands. This is a **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Soul%20Shaker.png)** (detailed at the end of this adventure). This creature has a fraction of the memories of **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)**'s friend Culley, but the horror has perverted those thoughts, seeking to control **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)**, manipulate her guilt, and use her to lure other victims into its lair. When it reveals itself, the soul shaker targets a character with its telepathy, whispering things like "Come play with us!", "Are you lonely?", and "Be with us forever!" as it attacks. It might also relate snippets from the "Fractured Soul" section of the adventure's background.

As soon as the soul shaker awakens, if the farmers the soul shaker controls are still in area F6, it summons them to aid it. The four farmers (use the **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Cultist.png)** stat block) arrive in 2 rounds.

**[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** is confused and terrified, and she stays out of the battle.

# Part 5: A Stories End

Once the soul shaker is defeated, its grip on the farm's residents’ fades.

## Kianna's Story

After the soul shaker is destroyed, **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** collapses into unconsciousness. A character who examines her and succeeds on a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check can tell **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** is sleep deprived and has been tormented by the strange creature. She wakes after an hour, unable to remember anything that's happened in recent days except for glimpses of strange hands and menacing words spoken in her dead friend Culley's voice. **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** shares that she blames herself for Culley's death at Cradlelace Lake, and when she heard his voice, she thought the gods might be giving her a chance to make amends. Now she just wants to return to Promise.

If asked about or shown her paintings from areas F3 or F4, she has no memory of creating them, though they're clearly in her art style. A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Wisdom (Insight or Medicine) check recognizes **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** is no longer suffering any supernatural effects, but the character also suspects her experiences might have affected her more deeply than she realizes.

## The Farmers' Story

If any of the farmers survived, the crimson hue vanishes from their eyes after the soul shaker's destruction, and they thank the characters for saving them. Even if the farmers in the house didn't survive, one or two lost in the fields arrive at the farmhouse.

The farmers remember only snippets from the last few days, and the last thing they recall clearly is preparing to return to Gullet Cove for the Awakening Festival. They also share that **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** had been behaving strangely, growing increasingly convinced that her dead friend was speaking to her. The farmers can also relate details from the adventure's background or about Cradlelace Lake if asked.

Although the farmers can't reward the characters with much in the way of wealth, seeing as they haven’t been able to farm for a long time. They do offer the party at small piece of advice. Be wary of the town guard in Gullet Cove. Those of the golden collar cannot be trusted, they forced us further south, rather than offer help.

## Back to Gullet Cove

When the characters return to Gullet Cover, **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt%20Dellie.png)** is overjoyed if **[Kianna](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png)** is safe and tearful if her goddaughter met a bitter end. Either way, she's grateful to the characters for uncovering the truth and ending the soul shaker's threat.

Arriving back at Gullet Cove the festivities have resumed. It would seem that once the character defeated the soul shaker, the enchanted farmers have regained all their awareness. **[Aunt Dellie](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt%20Dellie.png)** rewards the characters with her promised payment and ensures that the first few rounds of drinks that night are on her. The farmer whose knees were shattered will also have regained his composure, but will be in unbearable pain.
