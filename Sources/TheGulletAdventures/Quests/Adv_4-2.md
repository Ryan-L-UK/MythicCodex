# The Chapel Of Summoning

## Adventure Background

The Cult of the Ouroboros has discovered an ancient holy site
underneath the City Of The Dead. The structure is massive and
yet well-concealed requiring some careful problem solving to be able to enter.

The chapel is constructed of white howlite, which has allowed it to
weather the tumultuous tectonic activity in the region, but even so,
signs of its age can be seen. The weaker points of construction are
beginning to crack from the strain, rubble from centuries of tremors
litter the floor with pebbles and dust. Even the walls show great
fractures, scars from a lifetime of battle against the land herself.

Time is not their side. The cult needs a decisive victory here. As such,
they have gathered together for one final summoning before the
grand chapel succumbs to its fractures and is buried beneath the City of The Dead forever. If they are able to summon Ouroboros, it will take an army to
bring it down, and who knows what damage it might cause while it
runs amok.

Approaching the great stone structure, your party readies themselves
for a harrowing race against time, as the cultists rally to meet them
in battle.

# You Dropped This?

## The Siege Is Over

> The crisis of war has been adverted, by your respective hands no less, and the criminal Le-Furr is heading off to answer his crimes. Well more like he is going to lose his head BECAUSE of his crimes, but either way, you have not heard anything since, which you can only assumed is someone good news, in its own little way. Each of you took some well-deserved time off over the past few weeks and decided to pursue some of your own interests. Your paths no doubt crossed at points, but you each tended to go your own way. You all agreed to meet mid-morning today at The Water Bowl as last night it appeared to be the scene of a lot of commotion. On your respective walks over, a couple of you heard the townsfolk telling stories of what happened.

## Inside The Inn

- The Water Bowl is a well-kept tavern with just enough frills and rough
  edges to make most feel comfortable.
- The dining room has a bar and several tables, enough to comfortably hold
  up to 30. The morning meal here is a pleasant combination of bread and
  honey mixed with cinnamon.
- Between the outside light through the open windows or the green
  driftglobe over the bar, the dining room is brightly lit. These may be
  used to reveal title mark glyphs’ nature (see sidebar) such as the one
  on the map given to the adventurers.
- A handful of commoners are here eating breakfast.
- Duric Green the co-owner of the inn tends the bar.
  - He welcomes the adventures back, even though they have never been
    here and asks if they have come back to get their document?
  - Last night, cleaning up after a bar brawl, Zel found a strange
    looking page with no names or recognizable marks but possessive of a
    curious glow. The inn had no other overnight customers last night,
    so Duric believes that it belongs to one of the adventurers and will
    hand it to them. Otherwise he doesn’t have the slightest clue as to
    whom it may belong.
  - Duric suggests they see where the page leads, offering them a free
    meal and drinks at the inn if they come back with an entertaining
    story (and a cut of whatever treasure they happen to find, you know,
    “a finder’s fee!” of sorts. He winks knowingly).
- The page clearly doesn’t belong to the adventurers, but finding the
  actual owners is impossible, The Water Bowl was simply too busy last
  night. Plus, with all of the rumours about treasure in town, most folks
  would claim the paper in the hope it might lead them to the loot. As far
  as Duric is concerned, the page belongs to the adventurers now.

## The Cypher

> The map is on an interesting and unusual paper. The paper itself possesses some form of strange shimmer about it, it’s also unusually thick. It takes fairly little intelligence to realise this paper is far from ordinary. But the problem is its complete blank, less some strange circles and crescent moons around the edge of the page.

- A character with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check
  recognizes that magical light causes the glyph’s glow.
- The Magical Page after light exposure:
  - Under green light the following appears: **AWEMRWNETASNYUPAPKRDAEOE**
  - Under direct sunlight: **FOUR AT A TIME. READ TOP TO BOTTOM.**
  - Under firelight: **ARRANGE IN SIX ROWS.**
  - In near total darkness: **A SECRET ONLY LIGHT CAN TELL**

To solve, take the first 4 letters from the first clue and then write down the next 4 letters in a row underneath. This arranges the letters into 6 rows that looks like this:

|     |     |     |     |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  A  |  W  |  E  |  M  |
|  R  |  W  |  N  |  E  |
|  T  |  A  |  S  |  N  |
|  Y  |  U  |  P  |  A  |
|  P  |  K  |  R  |  D  |
|  A  |  E  |  O  |  E  |

When read from the first column, top to bottom, it reads:
**ARTY PAW WAUKEENS PROMENADE**

The Art Paw is an Art Shop in the market district ‘Waukeens Promenade’,
and should easily be remembered by anyone who has spent time around the
market district.

# A Crypt Portrait

## The Arty Paw

- The shop is on the first floor of a small 2 story building. A small,
  standard apartment is upstairs, and is the residence of the shop owner,
  Gath (a secret member of the Ouroboros).
- The shop itself is a display room, 15 feet wide by 50 feet long, with
  shelves spread throughout.
- A shop counter is along the back wall, next to a door leading to the
  back.
- Canvas artwork and painted trinkets are on display throughout.
- Most of the art includes a white full moon, and everything inside is
  pure white.
- The clue the adventurers seek is the wall mounted crypt portrait behind
  the shop counter. ‘Full Moon Crypt’
- The portrait features a statue pointing to a mausoleum crypt
  highlighted by a full moon in the background. In the centre of the
  painting several circles and crescent moons can be seen thanks to
  the pure white light, which match that same pattern of the page they
  have in front of them.
- No windows are present on the first floor. A chandelier candelabra
  provides bright white light.
- The rope holding the candelabra can be cut, dealing 1d10 bludgeoning
  damage to a creature standing under it. A successful DC 15 Dexterity
  save halves the damage.
- The Location. The crypt looks like many others.
- The adventures must either take the painting or study it long enough
  to note small identifying landmarks for locating the actual crypt.
- It is common knowledge that many of the art work in the gallery were
  painted by local artists. There will also be memories of the
  graveyard from the solstice and that there were several crypts like
  this. Perhaps it’s one of them.

## Some Resistance

- At first, Gath acts as a normal shopkeeper. When the adventurers show
  great interest in the crypt portrait, he views them as threats to his
  master to stop at all costs. He refuses all offers to sell the portrait.
- The crypt in the portrait belongs to his master, who values his privacy.
  Gath knows it will be a fatal mistake if his master discovers his
  portrait led others to his crypt. Gath knows nothing about the symbols
  on the piece, and is shocked by its resemblance to their page.
- The City Watch. If loud sounds result from a combat in the gallery,
  passers-by hear the disturbance. Fearing for Gath’s life, they call for
  the City Watch who arrive minutes later.

# The City of the Dead

## Location Description

The walled cemetery is a public park by day with the gates opening at dawn
and closing at dusk. As you approach the graveyard you are greeted with an
old sign carved into the stone holding the gate which reads ‘The City Of
The Dead’. The last time you came here, you were on the hunt of some
runaway Christmas trees and the whole land was covered in a blanket of
snow. It’s easy to see how that detail was overlooked.

Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (History) check recalls
the City of the Dead is the only place in Gullet Cove where the deceased
can be buried legally. The cemetery is vast and would take days to
examine.

The City of the Dead is surrounded by a wall of cobbled stone. Inside,
gravel pathways lead throughout the well-manicured gardens. Elegant
mausoleums, ornate gravestones and mournful statues adorn the public park.

## The Painting

The image contains clues to the crypt entrance. The painting features a
stone statue of a cloaked figure pointing toward a mausoleum in the
foreground. The statue in the painting is easily found on a north-eastern
hill in the City of the Dead. From there, the mausoleum can be found by
following the direction that the hand on the statue points toward.

## The Mausoleum

The mausoleum depicted in the painting is located west of the statue in
the Lords’ Respite area of the cemetery and belongs to a wealthy family.
The area has the following features:

- Mausoleum. This 10-foot by 15- foot mausoleum is a marble structure
  erected in the likeness of a stately house. Above its metal doors is a
  stone banner inscribed with the name “Gost.” It is 10-feet wide by
  15-feet long. Inside are four alcoves with grave markers for members of
  the Gost family. Some of the tiles have been broken.

- Pointing Statue. The statue of a cloaked figure stands on a 5-foot
  square, 10-foot tall plinth, and points toward the Gost mausoleum (which
  is a ruse; the mausoleum isn’t the entrance to the crypts). A successful
  DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, reveals the statue is a new addition to
  the cemetery. Any character who closely investigates the statue and
  succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check locates a catch
  inside a fold of its robe that opens a secret door at its base.
  Otherwise, it takes an hour for them to find the way in without making
  checks.

- NPC’s: Commoner (Blitz - Medium Sized Mongrel) warns the adventures to
  be careful there have been a lot of grave robbers around of late, and
  that the city guard have been extra vigilant of late.

# The Great Sigil

![Drakehall](http://localhost:8080/Sources/TheGulletAdventures/Quests/ImageMaps/ChapelOfSummoningDrakehall.html)

## Location Description

The first chamber of the Chapel of Summoning is an enormous rectangular
room with a carved mural on the floor depicting the Ouroboros. The great
twin-headed serpentine wyverns meet face to face at the far end of the
hall, their teeth wrapped around the other’s neck. Their twisting bodies,
complete with two feet and two wings each cascade down the relief in
mesmerizing fluid shapes ending at their tails which are conjoined at the
bottom. The bound tails form a bond that cannot be broken, and from which
there can be discerned no beginning or end. Six braziers (three to a side)
light up the mural. The walls are lined with pillars, each of which has a
word and number etched into it. The far door is firmly locked shut.

## Unlocking The Door

The pillars on the left side are numbered with odd numbers from 1 to 13
(top is 1, bottom is 13). The right side are numbered with even numbers
from 2 to 14 (top is 2, bottom is 14). The words etched are as follows:

> The words etched are as follows:
>
> - Prime
> - Light
> - Must
> - Top
> - Be
> - King
> - Conquered
> - Rage
> - Serpent
> - Bellows
> - By
> - Overlord
> - Dark
> - Numbers

## Solutions

The first and last words are “Prime Numbers”, and are a hint to form a
phrase using only the prime numbered words (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13). The
sentence forms “Light Must Be Conquered By Dark”, which is a clue to snuff
out the braziers.

You may choose to roll Intelligence Checks if your adventurers cannot come
to the solution. Roll with advantage if your player characters have
relevant mathematical, numeromancy, or cryptographic skills, or are
proficient in Navigator’s Tools, for example.

> You douse each of the braziers, and the mural in front of you begins to illuminate. Starting from the heads an ethereal blue glow snakes its way to the towards the entwined tails of the dragon carvings in front of you. Your eyes are drawn to a dark spot where both tails cross.

The tiles here are lose, and any form of tampering reveals a lever which
can be used to open the far door. However, if the room is not totally dark
when the door is opened, the room’s guardian, **[An'kheria, The Flame Breaker](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/An'kheria%2C%20The%20Flame%20Breaker.png)**,
will reveal itself and attack the party. This battle will also occur if
the party relights the braziers once the far door is open. The doors will
swing shut immediately and battle will commence.

# An’kheria

A great trap door will open from above, and into the room will drop what
appears to be a hideously deformed drake. Its scales are blackened with
fire and its body scarred from being used as a guardian by the cult for
centuries. It is missing one eye and detests the light, particularly fire
light. This is the light that had been used to scar it during its brutal
training as a wyrmling. Now all its beastly heart is sworn to is revenge
on any who bring the fire. Once a white dragon, its wings were clipped and
cauterized, but it still has teeth, fangs and its ice breath, all the
better to snuff out even the most resilient blaze.

## Battling The Drake

**[An'kheria, The Flame Breaker](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/An'kheria%2C%20The%20Flame%20Breaker.png)** is massive and ever in a blind rage. He takes up nearly half the floor
space of the Great Sigil and will make his first priority to cast the room
into darkness by targeting the blaze. Should anybody be foolish enough to
attack him with fire, they will be relentlessly targeted by the dragon
until they are subdued.

Once the fires are out, the dragon will be calmer and more methodical in
his attacks, seeking out the greatest threat first. If the players can
blind his other eye, he still can detect creatures within 10 feet of him
with blindsight. This dragon will not yield, and unfortunately, the only
hope for the creature is to bring an end to its misery.

When the battle is over, your heroes may proceed.

# The Summoning Circle

![Summoning Circle](http://localhost:8080/Sources/TheGulletAdventures/Quests/ImageMaps/ChapelOfSummoningCircle.html)

## Location Description

The latter chamber of the chapel is a hallway just as long as the great
sigil. Six pillars line the walls closest to the door, with four braziers
lighting the way to the centre of the room. A massive summoning circle,
threatening to call forth a beast of titanic scale, glows ominously,
bathing the chamber in unholy cerulean light. On closer inspection, the
circle is actually made up of six smaller circles with a void in the
centre where they connect. Each circle is manned by a hooded summoner on
the far end. As you enter you see six summoners are visiable, but two
appear to glow green, as if having their very energy drained from them.
The other four continue to chant as the first two collapse into dust.

At the far end of the hall is an altar with an unfortunate victim awaiting
sacrifice. The young man has blond hair and wears a ceremonial gown
embroided with the logo of the Ouroboros, a strange cult who worship the
twoheaded dragon. Considering he is unbound; the only conclusion could be
that he is a willing sacrifice to call forth his master. The great priest
behind the altar wears a horned helmet and stands with his hands poised
over the sacrafice, holding a ceremonial dagger. He noticed you enter and
places the dagger down on the table and picks up a monstrous battle axe.

> Interlopers. You dare to profane this sacred ground with your unhallowed flesh! I shall strike you down and your blood will slake the thirst of the mighty Ouroboros!”

## Battle With The Great Priest

Despite being present, the summoners nor the sacrifice will come to **[Ralof Serpentsworn](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Ralof%20Serpentsworn.png)**'s aid, as they are preoccupied with their duties. The party shall face **[Ralof Serpentsworn](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Ralof%20Serpentsworn.png)**
Serpentsworn alone. If the party consists of four or more players, you can
add one or two Ouroboros Knights to the battle. As the battle presses on,
one of the summoners will collapse from their lifeforce being drained. The
first summoner shall fall on the conclusion of the third round, and one
summoner will fall each round until all six have been drained.

If all six summoners are drained, the sacrifice is bathed in a vile
cerulean light, before being consumed entirely and bringing forth the
Ouroboros Emissary. If the party can defeat **[Ralof Serpentsworn](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Ralof%20Serpentsworn.png)** before the battle is
over, the Summoning Ritual will fail. Even if the summoners are attacked
by the party, their work will still continue from the afterlife. Any
attempt to aid or remove the sacrificial Knight from the slab will have
him engulfed in light early, and bring forth the Ouroboros emissary
immediately.

No matter what the party does to try and tamper with proceedings, the only
way to stop the summoning is to kill **[Ralof Serpentsworn](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Ralof%20Serpentsworn.png)** (or subdue him) before the
summoning is complete.

## Battle With The Emissary Of Ouroboros

Upon summoning the **[Ouroboros Emissary](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Ouroboros%20Emissary.png)**, **[Ralof Serpentsworn](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Ralof%20Serpentsworn.png)** will fall dead, his life force having been consumed in the summoning of the great beast. The creature is not the true Ouroboros,
but a lesser creature that serves him, taking the same shape of a
twin-headed dragon. While no dragon god, it is nonetheless a powerful foe
that must be destroyed lest it continues the work and calls forth the true
beast himself. Its twin heads will attack the party, each snapping after
its own target. It is capable of utilizing a lightning breath attack from
its blue head (on the left) and a flame breath attack from its red head
(on the right).

Upon the defeat of either **[Ralof Serpentsworn](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Ralof%20Serpentsworn.png)** or the Ouroboros Emissary, the temple will
begin to collapse under the strain from the summoning effort. A great
tremor will quake the entire structure and the party shall have to run to
escape.

**Note**: While escape should be fairly straightforward, you
can spice this section up with some skill challenges if you are so
inclined.

When the party is outside back in the City Of The Dead, they will find a
portion of the graveyard will have collapsed and the chapel will be
buried. The tremors will have been felt across this part of gullet cove,
so several people will have rushed to The City Of The Dead to find out
what happened. Several will appear concerned for the parties safety. All
that shall remain of the structure are the stone steps which will have
cracked and and crumbled. They will have crumbled so much as to reveal a
nook on a lower level that was previously buried beneath the dirt. In this
small nook is a stone chest where offerings were once placed for the
mighty Ouroboros.

Opening the chest reveals a bounty of 225 gold pieces, a golden holy
symbol with the Ouroboros etching (25 gp value), and four random gemstones
worth 10 gp each.

## Returning To The City

Returning to Gullet Cove will reveal a day like any other, people continue
to go about their day as if nothing had happened. Several of the townsfolk
do appear to be talking about the incident at the graveyard, but most seem
oblivious. A few people do keep talking about the storm a few days out at
see. The more you look, the more it does seem to trouble you.
