    "By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes {@condition invisible} and can't be targeted by {@filter divination spells|spells|school=D} or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.",
