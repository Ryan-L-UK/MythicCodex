    "Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with {@sense darkvision} can't see through this darkness. Non-magical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can't illuminate the area.",
    "Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking {@damage 8d8} psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."
