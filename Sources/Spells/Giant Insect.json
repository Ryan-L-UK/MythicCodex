    "You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration.

    "The DM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a {@creature giant wasp}."
