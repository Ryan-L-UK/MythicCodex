# The Good Mother
{color:#cca152}
This short section will outline the various changes and updates to religious faith ‘The Good Mother’ from the Secrets Of Gullet Cove handbook. These rules will replace and supersede any information within the handbook and any questions on the changes should be discussed with your GM. Anyone who has spend any considerable amount of time in, or around Gullet Cove will be aware of these changes. As will any followers of The Good Mother faith.

### The House Of Worship
{color:#FFFFFF}
{{width:20px}} The temple of Virtuous Probability worship ‘The Good Mother’, a Border Collie with a strong desire to help any and all creatures of the world. ‘The Good Mother’ herself was one of the first awoken dogs, and her teachings were aimed at the other awakened canines around her. Over the last 700 years there have been many changes to the religion, chief among them being the diversification and inclusion of all beings. Any and all are welcome to join the temple and follow in the teachings of ‘The Good Mother’. Not only cats are welcomed to the faith, but humans, elves and anyone else who might seek wisdom from her teachings. There are those who wish to go a step further and join the temple of Virtuous Probability as a priest, and they are more than welcome to do so. Although it is important to note, there are several rather steep prices to pay. 

### Priests of the Good Mother
{color:#FFFFFF}
{{width:20px}} To become a priest, you must surrender all your worldly positions, any gold, lands, titles, everything becomes property of the temple. However, that is not all, the two steepest prices to pay are that you must surrender your name, becoming simply a brother or sister of the temple, as well as your voice. The early teachings speak of how you must present a demonstration of your faith to ‘The Good Mother’. How she herself wished to help all creatures, and you as a priest must follow in her footsteps. It goes on to explain that the only way to help those around you is to listen to the call of the needy and you cannot listen if you are speaking. As such all brothers and sisters take a vow of silence for the remainder of their life.
<br>
{{width:20px}} Whilst the vow of silence is a scary prospect, there are a few situations where priests are allowed to use their voice, first and foremost is during religious prayer or chanting. Second is when performing any ritual spells or arcana, and finally when they are called to ‘The House Of Discussion’.

### Senior Memebers
{color:#FFFFFF}
{{width:20px}} Not all the priests are sworn to the vow of silence. Once you reach higher levels of priesthood you regain the right to speak at will. <br>
{{width:20px}} One of the main people who earn this is the High Priest. Their role is to lead the brothers and sisters of the temple, as well as interact with anyone who wishes to atone. They will also be involved in investigations and have been known to act as the voice of the temple during criminal trials. <br>
{{width:20px}} Second is ‘The Voice’ who devotes their entire life to reading the various books, letters and scriptures from ‘The Good Mother’. They are the living embodiment of her teachings and all their opinions and interpretations are treated as if ‘The Good Mother’ had said them herself. ‘The Voice’ is actually more respected than the High Priest due to their knowledge of the scriptures, and will lead the prayers of the congregation, as well as impart wisdom to those seeking it.<br>
{{width:20px}} Lastly is the Astronomer Of Solaris, a curious position held within the temple. They are to interpret the will of ‘The Good Mother”, by observing the weather, seasons and star constellations. Whilst this is a strange practise, in combination with ‘The Voice’, for hundreds of years they have been able to formulate a clear and coherent message. However, for the last 10-15 years the current holder from the post has shied away from this process entirely. Even the priests are unsure of what he is working on these days, all they know is the messages they are getting seem to be making less and less sense. 



### The House Of Discussion
{color:#FFFFFF}
{{width:20px}} Within the temple of Virtuous Probability is the House Of Discussion, which is a parliament room for worshippers of ‘The Good Mother’. Presided over by ‘The Voice’ the House Of Discussion is an open forum for all priests to voice their thoughts and opinions on any and all religious matters. This could be as simple as to discuss the next topic of religious teachings, or more serious situations, such as how to deal with an influx of religious sinners in the area. Be they big or small issues, all are given the opportunity to speak their views.<br>

{{width:20px}} The room itself includes a viewing gallery which is accessible from within the room and members of the town are permitted to attend to oversee the proceedings. Although whilst this option is always available, the temple tends to keep their meeting times private, so the option to oversee is rarely exercised. Nailed to the locked door, is always the agenda of the upcoming meeting, for any and all to see. It also should include the major topics, as well as the date and time of the meeting, although the high priest seems to keep ‘forgetting’ to include those last aspects. 



### Atonement
{color:#FFFFFF}
{{width:20px}} Famed for their desire to help people, they are the primarily religion sinners will approach for atonement. The various forms of atonement change person to person, sin to sin, but they are renown for helping any and all those who seek it.<br>
{{width:20px}} There is also another advantage for seeking atonement from the temple. Whilst under the protection of the priests, you cannot be arrested, prosecuted or tried for any crimes you have committed. This only applies until the priests are satisfied you have atoned for your sins, and whilst you remain on temple grounds. The minute you leave, the Watch are free to put you on trial. This has in fact been the cause for several of their priests over the years to take the cloth in the first place. <br>
{{width:20px}} Whilst this does sound convincingly like getting away with murder, it is simply not the case. Atonement for sins is not granted lightly, and whilst preferable to a public hanging, some of the methods might instead make you wish for a death…
