# Critical Hits & Critical Fails

Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. The attacker then rolls a second d20 and depending on the attack type, refers to the table below.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.

### Disarm Action

A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker makes an attack roll contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.

### Magical Disarm Action

A creature can use a spell attack to disrupt the target's spellcasting for a round. The attacker makes a spell attack roll contested by the target's spellcasting check (using their spellcasting ability modifier).

The attacker has advantage on its attack roll if it uses the same ability to cast spells as the target (e.g. Intelligence attacker and Intelligence target). The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if the target uses a different spellcasting ability.

If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the target cannot cast either a cantrip or a spell that uses a spell slot until the end of their next turn.

|   03   | **Is That The Floor?** You concentrate on your spell so hard, you black out and fall face down on the floor. You are now Unconscious until the beginning of your next turn                                                                                    |
| 04-07  | **Wild Magic Surge!** You lost control for a moment, you said words where you should gesture, gestured in place of words. Its all gone wrong, roll on the Wild Magic Table.                                                                                   |
| 08-11  | **What The Flick!** You flick your wrist a little too much and the spell flies in a random direction taking your self-confidence with it. Roll a wisdom saving throw DC 15, or suffer disadvantage to attack rolls until you next score a hit on an opponent. |
| 12-15  | **Where Is The Component!** This spell needs a very special component to cast, but where is it? In your haste you hurriedly empty your bag and something fragile breaks. Randomise fragile objects you have in your possession and roll to determine which.   |
| 16-17  | **Magical Backfiring !** You must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone                                                                                                                                                               |
