    <h1 id="ability-checks">Ability Checks</h1>
    <p>
      An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and
      training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The DM calls for an ability
      check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an
      attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the
      dice determine the results.
    </p>
    <p>
      For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six abilities is
      relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented
      by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The
      Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.

    <p>
      To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability
      modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and
      compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the
      ability check is a success--the creature overcomes the challenge at hand.
      Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no
      progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback
      determined by the DM.
    </p>
    <h1 id="using-each-ability">Using Each Ability</h1>
    <p>
      Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is
      covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail
      what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.
    </p>

    <h2 id="strength">Strength</h2>
    <p>
      Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which
      you can exert raw physical force.
    </p>
    <h3 id="strength-checks">Strength Checks</h3>

    <p>
      A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break
      something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute
      force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain
      kinds of Strength checks.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Athletics.</strong> Your Strength (Athletics) check covers
      difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming.
      Examples include the following activities:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while
        scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock
        you off.
      </li>
      <li>
        You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt mid jump.
      </li>
      <li>
        You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents,
        storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries
        to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your
        swimming.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Other Strength Checks.</strong> The DM might also call for a
      Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door</li>
      <li>Break free of bonds</li>
      <li>Push through a tunnel that is too small</li>
      <li>Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it</li>
      <li>Tip over a statue</li>
      <li>Keep a boulder from rolling</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="attack-rolls-and-damage">Attack Rolls and Damage</h3>
    <p>
      You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll
      when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a
      javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand
      combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.
    </p>
    <h3 id="lifting-and-carrying">Lifting and Carrying</h3>
    <p>
      Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The
      following terms define what you can lift or carry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Carrying Capacity.</strong> Your carrying capacity is your
      Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you
      can carry, which is high enough that most characters don't usually have to
      worry about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Push, Drag, or Lift.</strong> You can push, drag, or lift a weight
      in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength
      score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying
      capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Size and Strength.</strong> Larger creatures can bear more weight,
      whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above
      Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can
      push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.
    </p>
    <h3 id="variant-encumbrance">Variant: Encumbrance</h3>
    <p>
      The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a
      variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a
      character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this
      variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table in chapter 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are
      encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your
      maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means
      your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks,
      attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or
      Constitution.
    </p>
    <h2 id="dexterity">Dexterity</h2>
    <p>Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.</p>
    <h3 id="dexterity-checks">Dexterity Checks</h3>
    <p>
      A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or
      quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics,
      Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of
      Dexterity checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Acrobatics.</strong> Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your
      attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're
      trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay
      upright on a rocking ship's deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity
      (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including
      dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sleight of Hand.</strong> Whenever you attempt an act of
      legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else
      or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)
      check. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to
      determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip
      something out of another person's pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Stealth.</strong> Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you
      attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away
      without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Other Dexterity Checks.</strong> The DM might call for a Dexterity
      check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent</li>
      <li>Steer a chariot around a tight turn</li>
      <li>Pick a lock</li>
      <li>Disable a trap</li>
      <li>Securely tie up a prisoner</li>
      <li>Wriggle free of bonds</li>
      <li>Play a stringed instrument</li>
      <li>Craft a small or detailed object</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="attack-rolls-and-damage-1">Attack Rolls and Damage</h3>
    <p>
      You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll
      when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can
      also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll
      when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as
      a dagger or a rapier.
    </p>
    <h3 id="armor-class">Armor Class</h3>
    <p>
      Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your
      Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, as described in chapter 5.
    </p>
    <h3 id="initiative">Initiative</h3>
    <p>
      At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a
      Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in
      combat, as described in chapter 9.
    </p>
    <em>
      <h4 id="hiding">Hiding</h4>
      <p>
        The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you
        try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered
        or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom
        (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of
        your presence.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give
        away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or
        knocking over a vase. An invisible creature can always try to hide.
        Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay
        quiet.
      </p>
      <p>
        In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so
        if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you.
        However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay
        hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to
        gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Passive Perception.</strong> When you hide, there's a chance
        someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine
        whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity
        (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score,
        which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other
        bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For
        disadvantage, subtract 5.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2)
        has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and a proficiency in Perception, he
        or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What Can you See?.</strong> One of the main factors in
        determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well
        you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily obscured, as
        explained in chapter 8.
      </p>
    </em>
    <h2 id="constitution">Constitution</h2>
    <p>Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.</p>
    <h3 id="constitution-checks">Constitution Checks</h3>
    <p>
      Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution
      checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive
      rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or
      monster.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits,
      however.
    </p>
    <p>
      The DM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish
      tasks like the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hold your breath</li>
      <li>March or labor for hours without rest</li>
      <li>Go without sleep</li>
      <li>Survive without food or water</li>
      <li>Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="hit-points">Hit Points</h3>
    <p>
      Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you
      add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit
      points.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as
      well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if
      you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your
      Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point
      maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points
      for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level
      using your new modifier. Or if you're 7th level and some effect lowers
      your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1,
      your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.
    </p>
    <h2 id="intelligence">Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability
      to reason.
    </p>
    <h3 id="intelligence-checks">Intelligence Checks</h3>
    <p>
      An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic,
      education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History,
      Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain
      kinds of Intelligence checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Arcana.</strong> Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your
      ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols,
      magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those
      planes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>History.</strong> Your Intelligence (History) check measures your
      ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient
      kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Investigation.</strong> When you look around for clues and make
      deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation)
      check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the
      appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the
      weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through
      ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also
      call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Nature.</strong> Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your
      ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and
      natural cycles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Religion.</strong> Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures
      your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious
      hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Other Intelligence Checks.</strong> The DM might call for an
      Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Communicate with a creature without using words</li>
      <li>Estimate the value of a precious item</li>
      <li>Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard</li>
      <li>Forge a document</li>
      <li>Recall lore about a craft or trade</li>
      <li>Win a game of skill</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h3>
    <p>
      Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps
      determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
    </p>
    <h2 id="wisdom">Wisdom</h2>
    <p>
      Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents
      perceptiveness and intuition.
    </p>
    <h3 id="wisdom-checks">Wisdom Checks</h3>
    <p>
      A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand
      someone's feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an
      injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and
      Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Animal Handling.</strong> When there is any question whether you
      can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or
      intuit an animal's intentions, the DM might call for a Wisdom (Animal
      Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control
      your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Insight.</strong> Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you
      can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching
      out a lie or predicting someone's next move. Doing so involves gleaning
      clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Medicine.</strong> A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to
      stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Perception.</strong> Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot,
      hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your
      general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door,
      eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the
      forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss,
      whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the
      shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Survival.</strong> The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom
      (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group
      through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby,
      predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Other Wisdom Checks.</strong> The DM might call for a Wisdom check
      when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li>
      <li>Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="spellcasting-ability-1">Spellcasting Ability</h3>
    <p>
      Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability,
      which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
    </p>
    <em>
      <h4 id="finding-a-hidden-object">Finding a Hidden Object</h4>
      <p>
        When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door
        or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception)
        check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other
        information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for
        the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden
        beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you
        tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and
        furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless
        of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that
        you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have
        any chance of success.
      </p>
    </em>
    <h2 id="charisma">Charisma</h2>
    <p>
      Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It
      includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a
      charming or commanding personality.
    </p>
    <h3 id="charisma-checks">Charisma Checks</h3>
    <p>
      A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain
      others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or
      when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception,
      Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in
      certain kinds of Charisma checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Deception.</strong> Your Charisma (Deception) check determines
      whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through
      your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading
      others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations
      include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through
      gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with
      false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Intimidation.</strong> When you attempt to influence someone
      through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the DM
      might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include
      trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to
      back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to
      convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Performance.</strong> Your Charisma (Performance) check determines
      how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting,
      storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Persuasion.</strong> When you attempt to influence someone or a
      group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the DM might ask
      you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion
      when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests,
      or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include
      convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace
      between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Other Charisma Checks.</strong> The DM might call for a Charisma
      check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip</li>
      <li>Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation</li>
    </ul>

      Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their
      spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells
      they cast.

    <h1 id="saving-throws">Saving Throws</h1>
    <p>
      A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to resist a spell,
      a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don't normally
      decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your
      character or monster is at risk of harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability
      modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity
      saving throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can
      be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the DM.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard,
      for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill
      proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or
      her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability
      score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that
      causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is
      determined by the caster's spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the
      effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a
      creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.
