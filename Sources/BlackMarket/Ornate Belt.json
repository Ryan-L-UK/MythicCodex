    "This finely detailed sturdy leather belt is made from the hide of a dragon. The belt is typically dark red in colour, with a scaly texture that resembles the dragon it was made from. The belt is decorated with intricate patterns of gold or silver filigree, which glow faintly in the dark. This is some of the finest craftsmanship you have laid eyes on in some time."
