    "This strange and old looking spell book contains several scrolls for different spells. According to the shop keeper, each scroll must be mercilessly torn from the book to be used. The book is then said to restore any and all torn pages at dawn. Which explains why the cover of the book is old and tatty but the pages are perfectly clean and intact."
