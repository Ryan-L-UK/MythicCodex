    "This rainbow stone is about 9 inches long, and half an inch thick, resembling more of a pencil than a gemstone. The stone is labelled as a â€˜stone of summoning', although what it summons isn't exactly clear. To activate it, you split the stone in half, although the shop keeper won't allow you to test it. The stone is said to repair itself perfectly at dawn."
