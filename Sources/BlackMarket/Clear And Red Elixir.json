    "This elixir bottle is made up of a red liquid suspended in an excess of clear liquid. The red liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to replace the clear liquid around it, before contracting once more. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process, although does invite concern from the shop keeper."
