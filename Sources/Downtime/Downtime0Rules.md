# Downtime Activities

While your character is not adventuring, they can be performing _downtime activities_ that you pick from the list below. These activities all take time to complete, measured in _workweeks_ of 5 days, and usually also require money or other _resources_. Days of downtime activity do not need to be consecutive. Some activities can be completed by characters working together. Whislt most of these activities use the Adventurers League model, there are some subtle and key changes.

## Carousing

Carousing is a default downtime activity for many characters. Between adventures, who doesn't want to relax with a few drinks and a group of friends at a tavern?

#### Resources

Carousing covers a workweek of fine food, strong drink, and socializing. A character can attempt to carouse among lower-, middle-, or upper-class folk. A character can carouse with the lower class for 10 gp to cover expenses, or 50 gp for the middle class. Carousing with the upper class requires 250 gp for the workweek and access to the local nobility.
A character with the noble background can mingle with the upper class, but other characters can do so only if you judge that the character has made sufficient contacts. Alternatively, a character might use a disguise kit and the Deception skill to pass as a noble visiting from a distant city.

## Crafting an Item

A character who has the time, the money, and the needed tools can use downtime to craft armor, weapons, clothing, or other kinds of nonmagical gear.

#### Resources & Resolution

In addition to the appropriate tools for the item to be crafted, a character needs raw materials worth half of the item's selling cost. To determine how many workweeks it takes to create an item, divide its gold piece cost by 50. A character can complete multiple items in a workweek if the items' combined cost is 50 gp or lower. Items that cost more than 50 gp can be completed over longer periods of time, as long as the work in progress is stored in a safe location.
A character needs to be proficient with the tools needed to craft an item and have access to the appropriate equipment. Everyone who collaborates needs to have the appropriate tool proficiency. You need to make any judgment calls regarding whether a character has the correct equipment. The following table provides some examples.

| Proficiency             | Items                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _herbalism kit_         | _[Antitoxin (vial)](<http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Antitoxin%20(vial).png>)_, *[Potion Of Healing](http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Potion%20Of%20Healing.png)* |
| _Leatherworker's tools_ | Leather armor, boots                                                                                                                                                               |
| _Smith's tools_         | Armor, weapons                                                                                                                                                                     |
| _Weaver's tools_        | Cloaks, robes                                                                                                                                                                      |

If all the above requirements are met, the result of the process is an item of the desired sort. A character can sell an item crafted in this way at its listed price.

#### Magic Items

Creating a magic item requires more than just some time, effort, and materials. It is a difficult process that usually involves quests to track down the rare ingredients or forgotten lore needed to produce them.

---

## Crime

Sometimes it pays to be bad. This activity gives a character the chance to make some extra cash, at the risk of arrest.

#### Resources

A character must spend one week and at least 25 gp gathering information on potential targets before committing the intended crime.

## Gambling

Games of chance are a way to make a fortune—and perhaps a better way to lose one.

#### Resources

This activity requires one workweek of effort plus a stake of at least 10 gp, to a maximum of 1,000 gp or more, as you see fit.

---

## Performing Sacred Rites

A pious character can spend time between adventures performing sacred rites in a temple affiliated with a god he or she reveres. Between rites, the character spends time in meditation and prayer.
A character who is a priest in the temple can lead these rites, which might include weddings, funerals, and ordinations. A layperson can offer sacrifices in a temple or assist a priest with a rite.
A character who spends at least 10 days performing sacred rites gains *inspiration* at the start of each day for the next 2d6 days.

---

## Pit Fighting

Compete in boxing, wrestling, and other forms of (usually) non-lethal combat, in an organized setting. Requires Acrobatics, Athletics, and Constitution ability checks. You can replace any one of those ability checks with an attack roll made using one of your weapons.

#### Resources

1 workweek.

---

## Relaxation

Sometimes the best thing to do between adventures is relax. Whether a character wants a hard-earned vacation or needs to recover from injuries, relaxation is the ideal option for adventurers who need a break. This option is also ideal for players who don't want to make use of the downtime system.

#### Resources

Relaxation requires one week. A character needs to maintain at least a modest lifestyle while relaxing to gain the benefit of the activity.

#### Resolution

Characters who maintain at least a modest lifestyle while relaxing gain several benefits. While relaxing, a character gains advantage on saving throws to recover from long-acting diseases and poisons. In addition, at the end of the week, a character can end one effect that keeps the character from regaining hit points, or can restore one ability score that has been reduced to less than its normal value. This benefit cannot be used if the harmful effect was caused by a spell or some other magical effect with an ongoing duration.

---

## Religious Service

Characters with a religious bent might want to spend downtime in service to a temple, either by attending rites or by proselytizing in the community. Someone who undertakes this activity has a chance of winning the favor of the temple's leaders.

#### Resources

Performing religious service requires access to, and often attendance at, a temple whose beliefs and ethos align with the character's. If such a place is available, the activity takes one workweek of time but involves no gold piece expenditure.

---

## Research

The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.
When you begin your research, the DM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The DM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.

#### Resources

For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses (as discussed in chapter 5).

---

## Scribe a Spell Scroll

With time and patience, a spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll, creating a spell scroll.

#### Resources

Scribing a spell scroll takes an amount of time and money related to the level of the spell the character wants to scribe, as shown in the Spell Scroll Costs table. In addition, the character must have proficiency in the Arcana skill and must provide any material components required for the casting of the spell. Moreover, the character must have the spell prepared, or it must be among the character's known spells, in order to scribe a scroll of that spell.
If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the scroll works as if the caster were 1st level.

| Spell Level | Time to Scribe |    Cost    |
| :---------: | :------------: | :--------: |
|     1st     |     1 day      |   25 gp    |
|     2nd     |     3 days     |   250 gp   |
|     3rd     |   1 workweek   |   500 gp   |
|     4th     |  2 workweeks   |  2,500 gp  |
|     5th     |  4 workweeks   |  5,000 gp  |
|     6th     |  8 workweeks   | 15,000 gp  |
|     7th     |  16 workweeks  | 25,000 gp  |
|     8th     |  32 workweeks  | 50,000 gp  |
|     9th     |  48 workweeks  | 250,000 gp |

## Selling Magic Items

Selling a magic item is by no means an easy task. Con artists and thieves are always looking out for an easy score, and there's no guarantee that a character will receive a good offer even if a legitimate buyer is found.

#### Resources

A character can find a buyer for one magic item by spending one workweek and 25 gp, which is used to spread word of the desired sale. A character must pick one item at a time to sell. Very rare items, Legendary magic items and priceless artifacts can't be sold during downtime.

#### Resolution

A character who wants to sell an item must make a Wisdom (Perception) check to find the right kind of person who may want to buy a magic item. The character can always opt not to sell, instead forfeiting the workweek of effort and trying again later. Use the Magic Item Base Prices and Magic Item Offer tables to determine the sale price.

##### Magic Item Base Prices

| Rarity   | Base Price |
| :------- | :--------- |
| Common   | 100 gp     |
| Uncommon | 400 gp     |
| Rare     | 4,000 gp   |

##### Magic Item Offer

| 1–10  | 50% of base price  |
| :---- | :----------------- |
| 11–20 | 100% of base price |
| 21+   | 150% of base price |

## Sowing Rumors

Swaying public opinion can be an effective way to bring down a villain or elevate a friend. Spreading rumors is an efficient, if underhanded, way to accomplish that goal. Well-placed rumors can increase the subject's standing in a community or embroil someone in scandal. A rumor needs to be simple, concrete, and hard to disprove. An effective rumor also has to be believable, playing off what people want to believe about the person in question.
Sowing a rumor about an individual or organization requires a number of days depending on the size of the community, as shown in the Sowing Rumors table. In a town or city, the time spent must be continuous. If the character spreads a rumor for ten days, disappears on an adventure for another few days and then returns, the rumor fades away without the benefit of constant repetition.

##### Sowing Rumors

| Settlement Size | Time Required |
| :-------------- | :------------ |
| Village         | 2d6 days      |
| Town            | 4d6 days      |
| City            | 6d6 days      |

The character must spend 1 gp per day to cover the cost of drinks, social appearances, and the like. At the end of the time spent sowing the rumor, the character must make a DC 15 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the community's prevailing attitude toward the subject shifts one step toward friendly or hostile, as the character wishes. If the check fails, the rumor gains no traction, and further attempts to propagate it fail.
Shifting a community's general attitude toward a person or organization doesn't affect everyone in the community. Individuals might hold to their own opinions, particularly if they have personal experience in dealing with the subject of the rumors.

## Training

Given enough free time and the services of an instructor, a character can learn a language or pick up proficiency with a tool.

#### Resources

Receiving training in a language or tool typically takes at least ten workweeks, but this time is reduced by a number of workweeks equal to the character's Intelligence modifier (an Intelligence penalty doesn't increase the time needed). Training costs 25 gp per workweek.

---

## Work

When all else fails, an adventurer can turn to an honest trade to earn a living. This activity represents a character's attempt to find temporary work, the quality and wages of which are difficult to predict.

#### Resources

Performing a job requires one workweek of effort.

#### Resolution

To determine how much money a character earns, the character makes an ability check: Strength (Athletics), Dexterity (Acrobatics), Intelligence using a set of tools, Charisma (Performance), or Charisma using a musical instrument. Consult the Wages table to see how much money is generated according to the total of the check.

##### Wages

| Check Total | Earnings                                   |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| 9 or lower  | Poor lifestyle for the week                |
| 10–14       | Modest lifestyle for the week              |
| 15–20       | Comfortable lifestyle for the week         |
| 21+         | Comfortable lifestyle for the week + 25 gp |

## Personal Adventure

Sometimes characters may wish to pursue some solo adventuring or activities, so they may wish to use some, or all of their downtime. When it comes to adventures, there are a few options, you may:

- Pick up a bounty from the local message board for a reward.
- Investigate the rumour of a hidden magical item in the area.
- Go on a general expedition to see what you can find.

#### Resources

Each adventure, quest or bounty has its own gold, time or resource requirements, so depending what you would like to do, speak with your Dungeon Master to agree all the requirements.
