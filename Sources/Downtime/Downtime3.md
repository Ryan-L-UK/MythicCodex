# Downtime

Between adventures, the DM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity. Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your DM.

> This 'Downtime' took place between Adventures 5.1 & 5.2

### Leanthia

On your first night your newest companion, Leanthia invites you for a drink. Seeing as she is paying, it would seem rude to not join her. She goes on to share some info with you:

> My full name is Leanthia Cordel, and I am a thief, among other things. If I see someone who doesn’t deserve what they have then I’ll make sure they don’t have it anymore and will make sure someone who does need it has it. I guess it sounds pretty cliché, steal from the rich and all that but the rich are normally arseholes so it’s less about the money, more about the person. I hail from all over but I’ve only been on this island for a year or so, you know and then however long I was stuck in that damn dwarves hole.
>
> Yavanna was my partner, the better one of us definitely. She dealt with the magic whilst I dealt with the physical and mechanical. She had a few tricks that meant we got into places easy and I made sure she wasn’t in too much danger.
>
> I’ve worked with a few different groups, if we need someone in the underground I can probably find someone who remembers me (eventually). If you’re willing to help me out I’m willing to help you find and “acquire” what you want although I prefer to work with people that I can trust, tell me about yourself...

You decide to share some info back, although like anything, you only share the bits you want to, and leave out the stuff you don’t.

### Item Quest

You decide to spend your downtime questing after something to improve your musical abilities, but you are not entirely sure what. You have heard of drums that can help with your skills, as well as other items, but with little information to go on, you believe you are in for a hard 3 weeks. The phrase Needle in a haystack comes to mind, although this time, it’s probably more likely it’s a specific grain of sand in the Anauroch Desert\*.

You decide that you want to hit the Grand Library first, in the hope that the Priests may have heard something about any magical instruments in the area, but sadly they give you little to go on. They direct you to the Grand Library 'Wonderous Instruments' section, but aside from a couple of new melodies, you don’t learn much. You were able to find a section on the great bard, Finder Wyvernspur. It talks of his great deeds during the Godswar, but you learn little more. It does however reference a meeting of the Bards which apparently takes place once a year. Frustratingly for you, it was a few days ago, so you missed it, but you hope if you visit the tavern, you might be able catch one of them before they head off.

The meeting place is inside an Inn in the Iron Keep, which is located on Omans Isle, an island to the west. It only takes a few hours to make the journey, but the Sea of Moonshae is rough today. Tales of creatures lurking in the deep are not new to you, but tales of those lurking in the sky are! The clouds are thick and dark, and the winds are viscous and unrelenting, you fear the boat may capsize. There is movement in the sky, dark shadows move quickly through the clouds you actually fear for your life at times.

You arrive at the Iron Keep, somehow in one piece, and head straight to the inn and order a strong drink to calm your nerves. Carrying your harp, it’s obvious what you are and it would seem the barmaid has noticed. She walks over to your table and slides you a small pin which appears to be the mark of Wyvernspur. Whilst a nice gesture, you are unsure what she means by it, so she casually guides you towards a back room in the inn behind the bar. Inside the room is a large table, which clearly acts as some form of private meeting room. Although the room is a mess. It appears this was the host location for the bard meeting, but a brawl has taken place. The barmaid leaves you alone in the room, so you look around.

There is little of interest in here and you are about ready to give up when you find a note. It would appear to have been well hidden, and is branded with the mark of Wyvernspur, so clearly left for a reason. You open the letter and find it lists a location, Caer Westfall. You're not sure what this means, but something to keep in your back pocket for now.

> \*Anauroch or The Great Sand Sea, is a largest desert in the Sword Coast, and is located in northern Faerûn.

You also visit the Black Market 3 times in search of items that may peak your interest.

## Kerwyn

Your downtime starts with a trip to the Black Dragon Guild to report on the dealings of the shadow thieves. There is little to update to be honest, and nothing appears to be a surprise to them. The fact the shadow thieves have been working on an assault on the mainland does seem appropriate, given their organisation is much larger than yours, spanning across the whole of Faerûn.

You continue to ask for updates regarding your captor, or the boy and they once again offer you little information. Which whilst not necessarily a shock, it is somewhat disappointing to hear. So, you decide to head off to spend some time looking for shrines to the Raven Queen.

Before you are able to continuing looking, your new companion collars you for a drink. Seeing as she is paying, it would seem rude to not join her. She goes on to share some info with you:

> My full name is Leanthia Cordel, and I am a thief, among other things. If I see someone who doesn’t deserve what they have then I’ll make sure they don’t have it anymore and will make sure someone who does need it has it. I guess it sounds pretty cliché, steal from the rich and all that but the rich are normally arseholes so it’s less about the money, more about the person. I hail from all over but I’ve only been on this island for a year or so, you know and then however long I was stuck in that damn dwarves hole.

You decide to share some info back, although like anything, you only share the bits you want to, and leave out the stuff you don’t.

### Shrine Searching

You head around the city, and find that shrines to anyone outside of the Good Mother, are actually incredibly rare. It would seem as the largest religion in the city, it has somewhat taken over. You hear rumours of others, but the more you search the more it sounds like some little back street idea someone has regarding a deity, rather than an actual religious shrine or temple. So, you decide to leave the city for a while, explore some of the outer reaches to see what you can find. You hear rumours of something on Omans Isle in the Iron Keep, so you sneak aboard a ship destined there.

It only takes a few hours to make the journey, but the Sea of Moonshae is rough today. Tales of creatures lurking in the deep are not new to you, but tales of those lurking in the sky are! The clouds are thick and dark, and the winds are viscous and unrelenting, you fear the boat may capsize. There is movement in the sky, dark shadows move quickly through the clouds you actually fear for your life at times. You also try to keep yourself concealed and hidden as you notice that your companion, Elvis is on the same ship. He hasn’t seen you, and you would like to keep it that way.

The island is much smaller than Alaron, where Gullet Cover is located, but the Iron Keep certainly is impressive. Its walls tall and menacing, and the city well-fortified. This was one of the fortresses that was able to withstand the onslaught from the Aarakocra who tried to invade gullet cove, and it’s easy to see how.

Around the outer walls are a collection of shrines, and they all appear to be to different deities, but from what you can see none of them seem to relate to the Raven Queen. Until that is, you spot something on the edge of the forest, a black 10 feet tall obelisks. Perched on the top of which, is a Raven. How fitting.

As you approach, you find that the ravens gaze follows you. As if looking directly into your soul. You present the Raven trinket you have and the raven spreads its wings and takes the sky. You watch it flight directly up into the air, before dive bombing directly into you. You black out. The Raven Queen talks to you, she outlines how your faith can be stronger, how you can improve your arcane warlock spells, and also throws in several quips at how poor you are with the weapon she has gifted you. She doesn’t really impart much knowledge or guidance towards you, but simply having some time with her is gift enough. Satisfied, you make your way back to the mainland, unsure of how much time has actually passed.

You arrive back to find you are due to meet your companions later on this very day, but that’s not before you receive word from the Shadow Thieves guild. They haven’t got much, but they have given you a single piece of information. A location, Caer Westfall. At last, a possible heading.

## Leanthia

It’s a new world, or at least it’s the same world, but a century later. Last you knew the world was in the midst of the spell plague, a horrific time for all magic casters, and you hoped that it might help cover your assault on the dwarven vault. The Shadow Thieves Guild from Baldurs Gate asked you to search the vault, and it would seem that you were marked as 'Killed on Assignment'. A point you are not sure if you necessarily want to rectify. After all, being 'Dead' does offer certain advantages.

Having just been released from a time spell, you feel you deserve a stiff drink, and figured that this would be the best chance to carrel a little time with each of your new companions. A chance for you to get to know them, or at least understand if these are people who are likely to help or hinder you in the search for Yavanna. The Scratching Post is not your ideal tavern, but given your last inn was 'The Elfsong Tavern' in the slums of Baldurs Gate, it can’t be much worse.

#### Elvis

Your first 'experience' is with Elvis the Bard, and it is certainly an experience. He seems to take any opportunity possible to a sing a song, even if there is no reason to. Sure enough, it would seem that the tavern is no exception. As bards go he certainly isn’t bad, but equally his need for constant performance does grate on you a little. It would also seem that every night is the same, he stands up upon a stage he wasn’t invited on, sings a song or two, and then demands free food and a room. This custom is somewhat unusual to you, and to be honest, the inn keeper doesn’t seem to wild about it either.

Your conversation with Elvis is also decidedly one sided, he seems to insist on talking about himself the entire time, suggesting that he is world famous, and that everyone SHOULD know who he is. Whilst you were even having a drink, he took it upon himself to sign random pieces of parchment with his name, and then give them to other patrons of the inn, even if they didn’t actually want them... Normally you find most people hard to read, but this bard is decidedly one dimensional. He also seems really reluctant to discuss the right half of his face, which is hairless, seriously burned, and with a glowing red eye.

#### Ptolemeow

Your second encounter is with Ptolemeow, the artificer cat, who seems to have somewhat of an obsession with fire. Also, an interesting concept of self-augmentation. Although whilst the use of the word self is used here, it actually looks like the modification may extend to others too. For example, in your short conversation Ptolemeow has actually started to offer you some 'upgrades'. So far, the main focus has been your arms, and how they would look better if they were in fact flamethrowers. Whilst there certainly are some potential advantages you can see, especially in the height of an escape, you are a little concerned of Ptolemeow's ability to complete such modifications, and of course the potential hit to your nimble and dexterous hands. On second thoughts, you decide it may be best to leave well enough alone. He also seems to have drawn up some quite details schematics for an entirely augmented body...

#### Kerwyn

Kerwyn seems incredibly forthcoming with information as things go. He explains that he was found in a box by a young boy and raised in the Thieves Guild until he was around a year old. He goes on to explain that he was named Lord Kerwyn Lidda Tordek as the boy thought it sounded fancy. After a particularly successful job he was dognapped by a crazy man and experimented on and then branded with XVIII on his leg to mark him as his 18th experiment. Something must have gone right as thereafter he was 'awakened' and able to speak. Kerwyn continues to explain that the capture threw him out and he found his way back to Gullet Cove. Sadly, it would seem that the experiments had lasting effects as he can't remember the name of his boy, whatever the experiment did. However, he is determined to find him, whatever the cost.

Kerwyn's general mood then seems to change. He goes on to say that the Raven Queen is going to help him get revenge on the man who dognapped him. That when he finds him, his death shall be neither quick nor painless... and If he finds he harmed his boy to steal him... well... he can’t even imagine what Kerwyn will do to him...

#### Thorny

You have until this point been a little curious on Thorny, as it would seem the party has somewhat mixed feelings towards them. They are however fairly open with information. They go on to say that they were born in Neverwinter to a fairly humble Dwarvish family. Their father was a blacksmith and mother a barmaid. They attended a religious state funded school and found Tyr at a young age. As they grew, they swore an Oath of Devotion and joined the military as a paladin to fight in the holy war.

Witnessing terrible things in the war, including the slaughter of most of their battalion, Thorny escaped and exiled themselves to the islands, where they have been ever since.

#### Thnek

You try to find the goblin, however Thnek seems somewhat elusive and you are unable to find time to get a drink with him.

### The Shadow Thieves

You want to try and get yourself back in with the Shadow Thieves and find out a little more about what happened with Yavanna following the assignment to break into the vault. Given your history with the guild, you have no issue getting back involved, but you are a little concerned about the focus of this particular guild master. He seems incredibly focused on the conflict in Baldurs Gate, rather than the potential on his own front door. Although he does grant you permission to review the job archives, something usually reserved for high ranking members. You are unsure if this is because he genuinely wants to help, or the fact it got rid of you from his office so that he could ‘focus’.

You spend what feels like days looking through the archives finding nothing, until at last, you stumble on the assignment for the vault break both you and Yavanna were sent on. You can see everything, from the payment, to the date and time, and even your various Alias names. Yavanna's was always unmistakeable, and you notice that little more than a few days after everything went wrong at the vault, she appeared to get a new job. This time sending her to the Spine of The World, deep in the north, in the region of Icewind Dale, to the city of Kuldahar. She was tasked with meeting someone called Arundel, with what looks to be a raid on some crypts in the Vale of Shadows.

You see over the course of several years Yavanna’s name crops up on different jobs and assignments, until you see her name no more. Not even her alias, you look at her last task. It would seem that whilst in Baldurs Gate, she was specifically requested by a rather wealthy patron and sent back here, to Moonshae Isles to complete a job. You have no information on the job, or the outcome, all you have is a name, location and a date. Irenecus, Caer Westfall, 1429DR\*

### The Black Market

Something in the guild that does catch your eye, is the Black Market. It would seem to be a new addition since the last time you were here, and appears to be a clone of something similar you remember seeing on one of your jobs in Baldurs Gate. It would appear to have a selection of items for 'Reasonable' prices, depending of course on your definition of ‘reasonable’.

> \*1429DR is 53 years ago.

## Ptolemeow

Your downtime begins a little differently from the last. You normally have a feeling of doing something evil, but this time you have big plans. Plans for yourself. But first you need to draw up the schematics. You sit at the bar for the first few nights drawing up your plans, and on night two you are interrupted by your newest companion, Leanthia. She offers to buy you a drink, and seems to also choose to tell you her life story at the same time.

> My full name is Leanthia Cordel, and I am a thief, among other things. If I see someone who doesn’t deserve what they have then I’ll make sure they don’t have it anymore and will make sure someone who does need it has it. I guess it sounds pretty cliché, steal from the rich and all that but the rich are normally arseholes so it’s less about the money, more about the person. I hail from all over but I’ve only been on this island for a year or so, you know and then however long I was stuck in that damn dwarves hole.
>
> Yavanna was my partner, the better one of us definitely. She dealt with the magic whilst I dealt with the physical and mechanical. She had a few tricks that meant we got into places easy and I made sure she wasn’t in too much danger.
>
> I’ve worked with a few different groups, if we need someone in the underground I can probably find someone who remembers me (eventually).

You are polite and listen, but ultimately you know that they would be better with flamethrower arms and some serious body modifications. She doesn’t seem to share your enthusiasm all that much for the idea, you’re not sure why, so you return to your grand plans.

### The Change

Your plans are extreme, but you know there is no way you can do this yourself, you are going to need some help from the master builders. You head back to the temple of Gond, the Wonderbringer and seek an audience with the senior members of the Gondar clergy. They agree to meet with you and you show them your plans. At first, they are impressed at your creativity and ingenuity, commending your for your attempts to create consciousness. It is at this moment you explain you are not trying to build a new consciousness, but transfer your own to it.

The stunned silence in front of you suggests that what you want to do has never been done before, or at least never successfully been done before. They are keen to help, but they fear you may need more than just engineering prowess to be able to complete such a serious modification. After much discussion, they agree to help, but this is going to require a serious ritual, and a certain degree of sacrifice on your part to Gond to achieve your ends.

It takes a few weeks of building, but with the help of the Gondar, you create the perfect mechanical body to house your soul. It is cat shaped, and truly 'Purrfect', but now comes the part you have been dreading, the ritual. The clergy have informed you to transfer your consciousness, you will need to be smelted into ore, and poured as molten metal into the mechanical body, then, only if you are deemed worthy by Gond will you be reborn.

This is actually shockingly dangerous, and being smelted doesn’t exactly sound like a barrel of laughs. It also sounds like you might actually have to become a cat of religion to make this work, as from with the clergy say, if you stop believing at any point, you may cease to exist. But any port in storm, this is all for the greater good, and as far as you are concerned, if some bearded moron in the sky needs you to 'dedicate' the odd kill or machine to him, so that you may be reborn as a machine, then so be it.

The ritual is long and painful, and you haven’t even started the smelting yet. So many readings, so many biblical bullshit to content with, but you just smile and grin through it, nodding where applicable, and giving your pleases and thank yous, even if some are through gritted teeth. Now comes the bit that actually might hurt. The Smelting. You got to choose your alloy, Meteorite, which you will become bonded with for all eternity. Now you must climb into the crucible with the raw ingots and begin the bonding process. To say it hurts is an understatement. Sitting inside a giant cauldron, which is being heated to outrageous temperatures with ingots melting around you is some of the most extreme pain you have ever felt. And you have had to listen to Elvis perform his famous 4-hour monologue performance. At some point you lose consciousness, and presumably, you die, although interestingly you have no memory of that.

The first thing you notice is the feeling of being cold. But not cold because of a light breeze, or a sudden snow fall, cold as if touching a sheet of cold steel. You open your eyes and notice you have a collection of overlays across your vision. Targets, crosshairs and alike. You have been reborn, an autocat. The Clergy start calling praises Gond, and you think about doing the same, before deciding you will do that later. For now, you need to learn to walk again and get used to your new metal body, as you are due to meet your companions in a few hours...

## Thorny

You decided to use your downtime to start a small personal quest of yours, spreading some rumours of your success and greatness. It would seem you have so far managed to keep your hidden past secret from your new companions, but you fear they are getting wise. Elvis doesn’t seem to believe much you say, and despite your best efforts, the goblin doesn’t seem to be warming to you.

You head out of town and Heading out of town you make your way to a small farming settlement in the south you have heard of, Ulgoths Beard. It takes you a full day to get down there, and the road is not exactly nice, along the way there is even a pit where part of the path has collapsed. The pit would appear to be relatively new and it would seem that there are even severed hands lying around the edge. No one has taken the time to repair it yet, or clear away the rotting hands. It looks like it might even be a possible option for you to help show your greatness. Fill in the pit and I’m sure the local townsfolk would love you, although possibly not. It looks like a lot of work, and you know, you would hate to throw out your back before heading off on your next adventure.

Making your way to the farming village you find that it seems to be in the midst of being repaired, with windows being replaces, and houses being repainted. The crops themselves also look a little worse for wears, but there are at least new bright green shoots coming through, so there might be life here after all.

Heading over to the first villager you find, you find a young girl called Kianna who appears to be painting over a large X on the door of a house. You ask her what is going on, and she is really forthcoming with information and explains how their village had been the host for an evil blight which has now passed thanks to the help and support of a great group of adventurers. Not to be out done, you start to outline your most recent deeds, although you make it sound like you are talking about someone else so not to appear like you are bragging.

You mention that a great Paladin called Thorny Brimblepot used their holy power to single-handedly bring down a foul demon and is a pure-hearted individual. The more you tell this story the more impressed the locals appear to be. You ensure to embellish the story where possible to make sure your deeds seem truly amazing.

Seeing the success, you are getting in spreading the good word, you decide to see if you can also sow some evil too. Starting small, you decide to pick on the Captain of the golden collar, suggesting that he is into some disturbing stuff. Before you can even start to sow your rumours, someone in the town suggests they have heard he is into the exploitation of minors, that they like them 'young & firm'. The notion of this does make you feel a little ill, as whilst you wanted to say exactly this, it was one thing for you to make it up, but an entirely different thing for there to actually be some truth behind it.

### Leanthia

Once you have decided you have had enough of your rumours you make your way back to the city and your newest companion, Leanthia invites you for a drink. Seeing as she is paying, it would seem rude to not join her. She goes on to share some info with you:

> My full name is Leanthia Cordel, and I am a thief, among other things. If I see someone who doesn’t deserve what they have then I’ll make sure they don’t have it anymore and will make sure someone who does need it has it.

You decide to share some info back, although like anything, you only share the bits you want to, and leave out the stuff you don’t.
