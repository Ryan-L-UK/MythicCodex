# Downtime

Between adventures, the DM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.
Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your DM.

> This 'Downtime' took place between Adventures 4.5 & 4.6

### Weeks 1, 2

The concept of ‘Downtime’ is somewhat wasted on you, given there are always things you can be doing to improve your knowledge and understanding. Or even helping those around you, which is how you plan to start your first week. The devastation of the storm is very much a point of concern for you as there are plenty of people injured.

Seeking advice from the landlord of the scratching post you make your way to some of the worst impacted districts and start to offer any and all aid you can. Mostly it is basic healing and bandaging, but occasionally some people are just lacking a good meal, so you offer good berries where you can. Its slow and somewhat tedious work, but you do feel like you are at least making a difference which is the main thing.

At the end of your first day, you decide to try something new, and make your way over to the Temple Of Virtuous Probability. They welcome you back and invite you in. You ask, as before if you may spend some time in the greenhouse, and that if you might even be able to stay in there overnight. The priests do look a little confused by this prospect, but given the work you have done for them in the past, they allow it, and even set up a simple bed in there for you to use. Its not the most comfortable in the world, but least they tried, which is the main thing. Flo comes to join you in the greenhouse, although the temple did ask that ensure she not eat any of the plants, which she begrudgingly agrees to. You sleep the night away in the hope to commune somewhat with nature, but your dreams are simple and meaningless.

On your last day you reach the closest part of the town to the sea, and some of the worst impacted. You notice however that the people here seem to talk differently of the storm. Everyone so far has suggested it was a freak bit of nature, here they talk more like the storm was targeted, almost alive. You know enough about magic to know that weather manipulation like this would be the stuff of gods, not men, and their suggestion is ridiculous at best, so you dismiss it and move on.

Having offered as much as you can, you return to the temple and discuss how this repair is actually being funded. They confirm that they are custodian and main provider of all the funds. They do mention some contributions from various wealthy townsfolk, the council and so on. They are clearly not sharing everyone who has funded the rebuild, and you’re not sure why. But that’s not your priority, you offer to fund some of the rebuild yourself and they are happy to accept any and all donations.

### Week 3

You approach the third week and decide that you have been in the city enough and make your way out to the forest where you stayed before. The route is familiar and safe, all be it with some traces of snow here and there. After a short time you are even able to find the exact spot you were before, although a look at the remains of your camp fire suggest it has been used recently by someone or something. A look around the area and you are even able to find your picture still remains nailed to the tree where you left it. The ink has run in places due to the weather, but overall, it still looks as good as the day you drove a nail right through the centre of it. For some reason…

You start work on a shelter, it’s simple, but more than good enough for you and Flo. Then you settle down for the night. The next morning you begin to commune with nature, you spend time listening to the sounds of the forest. That is, until something causes you to shudder slightly. You decide to not break your concentration, what ever was meant to happen, is going to happen, if Silvanus is truly with you, this is all part of some plan. Your eyes remain firmly closed as you feel something sniff your face, at first you are unsure if it was Flo, but no, she is asleep behind you. You feel it take another breath, you crack your eyes slightly and before you stands a fully grown owlbear.

Face to face with an owlbear you fight every urge you have to want to flee, this beast could end you in a second, but no, you sit, close your eyes once more and slowly raise a hand. It takes a few seconds for you to reach the side of its head, but once you do, you begin to feel it's feathers. It recoils at your touch and you brace for the imminent strike. But to you surprise, you then feel the owlbear return to your hand once more, leaning in, and slightly nuzzling your hand. It steps back and content you are not a threat it leaves you be, walking away back into the forest. You keep your eyes closed and take a big breath of relief before you hear a voice talk inside your head with a familiar calmness.

> “Cedar, I feel you have many questions, religion is a new concept to you and I understand how that can make you feel. Fear not, I will provide answers in time, and will guide you when you seek it. You have proven in the face of natures terror, you can remain calm, collected, and even find kindness. You have proven you understand that not all nature is out there to harm you. So, with this I bestow upon you another gift, I ask that you use it wisely, and remember that I am with you, always.”

The voice in your head slowly fades out and you feel a new power rise up inside of you. You’re not sure what the source of this power is, but the gift it has bestowed has certainly peaked your interest.

> You may now wild shape into an owlbear, as you would any other creature. Your DM has a creature card if you would like one.

### Week 1

#### Shopping

Taking your first day of downtime, you decide you would like to start with a little shopping. The orb has been calling to you somewhat, and you have decided to allow it, embrace the new ideals. Even if they are not exactly the ones you held when you left the Feywild. Today is a ‘Winters’ day, and you are not really in the mood for people, so on retrospect shopping may not have been the best of ideas for today.

Your first port of call is to make your way to the same back-alley shop as before in the quest for blood. The shop remains unchanged, everything is still covered in blood, and you are unsure if anyone actually ever goes inside, except you. As you walk in, the sweet smell of fresh blood hits you, cinnamon rolls have got nothing on this. This is liquid sugar and you want it, and sadly for you, the shopkeeper knows it.

In standard negotiation tactics, the shopkeeper starts by explaining that blood is hard to get hold of, finding it this fresh is a challenge, etc, etc. To be honest, he waffles on, but you are fixated on the prize, the vial. That is, until he clearly loses his mind, and tells you that this vial will cost you 180gp, as opposed to the 55gp of last time. Your eyes snap with anger to meet his, and despite realising he may have overstepped his mark slightly, he stands firm. So, you decide to take things up a notch, or 15.

You are not in the mood for this guy’s bullshit, so you wasting no time in casting Prestidigitation, creating glowing glyphs and symbols all over the room for dramatic effect. You then start to swirl your hands menacingly in the air as you begin to cast Chromatic Orb. The red sphere of energy manifests into existence in front of you, and the shopkeeper begins to realise that he may have made a serious mistake. He starts immediately lowering the price slowly, so you continue to cast hitting second a second level spell slot quickly. Fearing for his life, the increments get faster, until at last he is just shouting ever decreasing numbers whilst falling to his knees.

You’re not really sure at what point he realised you had dismissed all the spells, but somewhere around 30gps you stopped, and somewhere around 15gp you accepted the price.

Seeing this as an opportunity, you also use this time to speak to him about the possibility of casting the ‘Crimson Stone’ into a silver choker. To which he accepts and if you promise to not destroy his entire livelihood, he will do for 5gp and have it completed by the end of the day.

You then decide to check out the brand-new black-market shop, Sielf emit to see if they have anything of interest:

> Ask your DM for the days item listings (Day 1)

#### Research

The rest of the first week is spent in the various libraries research the concept of plane shifting, who can do it, how it works and so on. You find yourself gravitating to the same collection of information, regardless of which source book you pick up. ‘The Wise Alaundo’. A powerful caster of sorts, it would seem there is some link to him and the ability to switch planes, there are even stories he was able to cause two planes to overlap, creating a bridge. But these are interesting concepts, there is no guidance or evidence as these books were written hundreds of years after Alaundo’s supposed passing. That’s if he ever really existed.

### Weeks 2 & 3

Deciding that you need some time out of the world, exploring natural sources of magic, you make your way out Dernal Forest in the west. You have been warned that if you venture too far inside that it is the home of curious and dangerous monsters, but you know better than to listen to townsfolk warnings. It’s probably an oversized chicken or something.
You arrive at what appears to be an old campsite of sorts, there is what remains of a fire, some curious small tracks, and a picture of a flower nailed to a tree. The flower is nicely drawn, and coloured with inks, all be it, the inks have run a little in places due to the snow, but the picture looks nice. That is, until you notice it has been held to the tree by driving a nail right through the centre of it, ruining it. You stay here for a night, before moving on, leaving no trace of your presence.

You quickly pick up on a magical line, a source of some kind of energy, its old though, really old. You start to follow it through the trees, heading north, then west, the north some more. It is strange, the route makes no logical sense, and you find yourself crossing routes you have already walked. Several days of walking you find yourself at the foot of a mountain range. There is a tunnel heading down into the deep of the mountain. The doorway is huge, yet natural, as if created over thousands of years, but there are stairs descending down hewn from the rock. You want to head down, to see the source of the magic, but you know that you have reached the end of your downtime, and must head back if you are to meet your companions upon the agreed day. Maybe next time…

## Elvis

### Shopping

Somewhat forgetting your new attire as you get up on your first day, you make your way downstairs, and are somewhat put off by the odd looks people are giving you. Not really sure what their problem is, you assume it’s something to do with you being the one and only Elvis, master bard of the region, and that these are clearly your fans. Not that it matters, you had plans to do some light shopping, possibly even venture to the new Black-Market shop ‘Sielf Emit’ if you get time. It is only as you walk along towards Waukeens Promenade, you catch your reflection in the shop window and realise why people have been giving you odd looks. Yes, the mask, you’re going to need to find out how to deal with this.

This urgency and desire to want to deal with the problem is somewhat increased as you walk towards Waukeens Prominade and a small child in a mask runs up to you excitedly asks if she can swap with you. Before you have any moment to protest, she begins pulling on the eye holes of your own. The straps tighten a little more, and you let out a sound, that thanks to the mask, echoes and resonates in a harrowing way. It’s enough to make grown men in the street back away slowly, so naturally the little girl in front of you burst into tears and runs off screaming for their parents.
You arrive at Sielf Emit and begin perusing their wares.

> Ask your DM for the days item listings (Days 1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,13,14)

### Research

The mask getting tighter every time someone pulls on it, is somewhat of a concern, especially considering the irreparable damage it could be doing to your beautiful face. This being a matter of some urgency, you decide if anyone is going to know, it’s the priests at the temple, you make your way to the Temple Of Virtuous Probability to see if they know anything about this.

You walk into the temple and as you walk in the door you notice that several of the priests slowly back away from you, which is not necessarily a good sign. You go right to the High Priest, uninvited and burst in the door to ask for some advice. The High Priest was enjoying a gloriously old vintage fortified wine from their private reserves as you walk in. The key word in that sentence is ‘was’. As you walk in, they spit the entire contents across the room and their grip on the glass tightens so much it shatters into a million pieces spilling the remaining wine across their desk.

The high priest stands suddenly and summons a staff and begins chanting, when you reassure him it’s you, Elvis, and that you may have got yourself in a little hot water on this one. You are able to prove yourself to him, and he relaxes somewhat before asking how you came to be in possession of the ‘Mask of Nihilus’. You give what little explanation you can of the various events that lead to this, and start to enquire what he knows of it.

Over several days of intermittent visits, you are able to come to a few, basic conclusions. Firstly, and probably most importantly for you, this mask is not coming off in a hurry, at least not without some very strong curse removal magic, beyond the skillset of any of the priests. Secondly, that this mask is a source of great evil, belonging to an evil wizard demi-god called Nihilus.

There isn’t much know of this artefact, but it is said that the mask has the power to twist the hearts and mind of whoever wears it, offering more power, at the price of their own alignment. The longer one wears the mask, the more power they gain, but at the price of becoming more evil. It is said once the transformation is complete, the mask will untie and fall off, awaiting its next victim.

Any attempts to remove the mask by force will be met with resistance in the form of the straps tightening, but you already knew that last point first hand.

## Kerwyn

### Weeks 1, 2 & 3

For your downtime you decided to offer a hand to help the city of Gullet Cove recover from the devastation the storm caused. Whilst the storm has passed, the scars it has left on the city are deep and will not fade fast. Feeling the call to help the thieves guild, you head to the north west to help at Black Dragon Gate. This area has always been a hive of wicked and villainy, with any who deny it a fool, or under the influence of some form of arcana. But this time it feels different.

You know from your time adventuring through the world of Faerûn, that areas like this are left to fend for themselves, often becoming the victims of much looting and violence, but this time it seems somewhat different. People are venturing from the nicer parts of town, in Cliffgate and Manorborn to help. It takes time, but slowly the area starts to resemble some of its former glory. You toil through the days, asking for no reward, just doing what little you can to help. The guild have noticed that you offered to help and they are impressed, perhaps you can expect some work from them in the future.

As your first week draws to an end and you start the second, you move over to a part of Black Dragon Gate which has yet to be cleared from the storm. This part of the town still has large buildings that have collapsed in upon themselves, and the dead have yet to be cleared. Under normal circumstances, you would consider looting, after all, the dead have no use for trinkets, but somehow it feels wrong.

As you start clearing one the collapsed buildings you hear the sound of faint screams and coughing. You dig a little faster, to hear faint calls for help. Someone is alive here, they have been trapped for days, with no food or water, but somehow, they are alive, just. If only you could get to them. You try with all your might, being a Saint Bernard, you figure if anyone has a chance its you. But this cross beam will not budge. What remains of the roof supports have pinned the rubble. You try again, but you fear that if you make a wrong move, the whole thing could come down.

You panic a little, you’re not one to care of others, especially since your new found love of murder and violence, but for some reason you are feeling the urge to save someone. You decide to call upon something somewhat unorthodox, and you’re not entirely sure it will work, but any port in a storm, and seeing as the storm has passed, this port is the only one you have left. You draw your rapier and point it to the sky, close your eyes and concentrate. Above you a small number of black clouds begin to form; they swirl and spiral downwards towards your extended blade. As the clouds touch the tip of the blade, there is a sudden powerful pulse of energy that radiates from you. The pulse causes anything not nailed down to fly backwards at speed. The debris is cleared in an instant, revealing a small child.

The small child stands, rubs her eyes and walks towards you. The child’s hair is long, black and knotted, their face pale and white, their eyes a curious shade of brown, so dark it makes them almost seem black. Their attire is also dark looking, this is not your average child. You go to reach out a hand, to help them from what remains of the ruined building. You hope to help them find their family, or see if they could become a foundling for the guild. Before you can do so however, a sly smile stretches across their face. Then they speak, but with every word, it is like 1000 voices are talking in unison:

> “The Queen of Ravens is pleased. Her grace was concerned that you were not committed to her, but after you sacrificed in her name, she is pleased. Here is another example, you were not strong enough, and she gifted you power in your time of need. Her grace would like to gift you a token of her appreciation, as well as a reminder, that your power is a gift, and that all gifts can be reclaimed, violently, if they are not appreciated.”

The child holds a hand outstretched with a Silver Raven in it. You reach out and take it, somewhat concerned that a small child has become a puppet of the raven queen, but also pleased that your patron has taken the time to value you. As you take hold of the Raven, the child dissipates into a shower of assorted black birds, which fly straight up towards the black clouds above you. The clouds vanish quickly and the clear blue sky returns once more.
The rest of your time passes relatively uneventfully, but the words of the Raven Queens Puppet ring in your ears constantly. Perhaps honouring the Raven Queen might need more than that odd sacrifice here and there. But still. You have earned favour in her eyes, as well as the guilds, so time well spent.

> Ask your DM for your ‘Gift’

## Ptolemeow

### Week 1

You have decided you want to pay some tribute to Gond, the Wonderbringer, but in a city with such a huge following to ‘The Good Mother’ finding a temple with which to offer service proves somewhat of a challenge. After a few days you are reminded of the two Blacksmiths ‘Hammer & Anvil’. If anyone would know its them. In hushed voices they direct you to the temple, it’s not that other religions are frowned upon here, it’s more that they would like to keep the temple for the select few, not just any old riff raff. You follow the directions and find in a back street of Waukeens Promenade a simple looking stone structure, boxy looking with strong simple columns. It would seem this place is built for purpose, not looks.

Inside you find a pair of Gondar clergy wearing saffron ceremonial vestments with a crimson collar. You approach and they reach to offer you a blessing in the usual way, which ultimately you don’t care about, but best keep up appearances. You offer your services and they enquire as to your skill-set. You advise them of your strong points and they direct you to help repair some of the war machines that defend the bay. You have a brief puzzled look when they ask this of you, but they soon speak up:

> “Oh, did that fool Timory tell you he designed them?” They share a laugh before the other speaks “Oh no, that fool couldn’t cast a nail from a ton of steel. We created them, designed them and then planted our finest smithies to build them in the bay under his ‘leadership’. But we assure you, he had nothing to do with it at all”. They laugh some more at the notion Timory could amount to anything.

This news doesn’t come as a shock really, Timory has always seemed like somewhat of an idiot to you, all this has done, is confirm it. This at least gives you the opportunity to get a good look at the mechanism of this triple canon setup they have on the harbour walls. Something you have wanted to get up close and personal with for a while.

It takes you a couple of days to get the mechanics working again, but you are impressed, it is interesting engineering, and you think perhaps in time, you might be able to utilise this same technology in your own canons. Your work complete, you decide to head to the new black-market shop ‘Sielf Emit’.

> Ask your DM for the days item listings (Day 6)

### Weeks 2 & 3

For the rest of your time, you feel you have done enough to help, and would like cause some mischief, and coincidentally your new ‘friends’ at the ‘Builders Temple’ may have given you a lead. They have decided that the Temple Of Virtuous Probability has far too much traffic for their liking and your job is to see if you can steer some away from them. They are not entirely worried where said traffic goes, just as long as it isn’t to them.

You take some time to think about how you could do this. The temple is huge and vast, it would take some serious explosives to make a dent, but perhaps you are going about this all wrong, perhaps there is a new idea. You wonder if you could disguise yourself as a priest and are suddenly reminded of the sewers when you were chasing Le-Furr. There were some old bodies down there, including one of a priest. You make your way to the sewer entrance, which despite you warning the guards, they have done nothing about. It opens easy and you head down to collect the robe.

You don your new attire and make your way into the streets, covering your face with a mask, making sure it is nearly impossible to identify you. Strolling through the city, you are looking for a target. You're not sure who the target is yet, but you’ll know when you see them.

Then, there they are, an old crone with a stick. You start to follow her, she takes a left, then a right, down a back alley, and you seize the moment. With a single move you kick the cane from her hand, and she falls to the ground with a thud. You then draw your knife and hold it to her neck. You tell her that the temple has been watching her, and that the temple demands a donation in the form of all her valuables. She doesn’t have much, but that’s not the point, it’s about sending a message. You gain little more than 3 silver pieces, but as you let the knife up, she crawls into the street calling that a priest had just robbed her.

You do this a few more times across different parts of the town, and before long, everyone is talking about how there is a temple are robbing people of their valuables in the name of a ‘donation’. This was a simple plan, that seems to have gone completely successfully, so you head back to the Builders Temple, for your reward of 15 gold pieces. You also elect to not tell them about the ‘donations’ and pocket the 16 silver you stole from the town’s folk. All in all, a profitable time.

On your last day, you head to Sielf emit once more:

## Thnek

### Week 1

You awaken, not entirely sure what to do with yourself over this block of downtime, but you figure with your returned wealth, that you should put it to some good use. You decide to visit several of the stalls and venders within the town, before heading over to the newest shop Sielf Emit, the black-market dealer.

> Ask your DM for the days item listings (Days 1-5)

### Week 2

Your first week passes by relatively slowly, but you feel rested. You decide you want to get back into the pit fighting scene. You sit in the bar trying to remember where the pits were, as the door to the bar opens. You look up to see a familiar face walk through the door. It’s the dwarf from your last block of downtime. His eye seems to have healed up nicely, for now. He catches your glance and he recoils slightly, but it’s too late, you feel the rage rising and you leap from the table at him.

It would seem he has learned a few tricks since the last time you fought him, you swing the first time and he ducks, but it’s alright, because the second swing from your offhand cracks his jaw. You notice him reach for a knife on his belt, which you decide is simply not sportsman like, so you high kick his elbow which snaps like a twig. He cries in pain, but that just spurs you on a little more. You point to your forehead, which causes the dwarf to look up, angling his nose just perfectly for the headbutt you deliver cracking it and sending blood everywhere.

The door swings open as the dwarf hits the deck, and three men in full black plate mail with glowing plumage walk through the door. They look to the dwarf and then to you, and call:

> “I SERVE THE FLAMING FIST!”

You remember these, extremist from the Golden Collar. There are gasps from the patrons as the three full sized men grab you. You struggle and kick, but against these three men, you are outmatched, outsized, and under equipped. They carry you out of the inn, your legs dangling and flailing, before they cover face in a hood laced with something and you black out.

You awaken a few days later, in a cell, with a flaming fist guard standing outside the cell. They keep you locked up for 3 whole days before they let you go. They were not exactly unkind to you, but they also were not particularly welcoming either. It also doesn’t help that you’re not exactly sure what you did wrong to warrant this kind of treatment.

### Week 3

Your third week begins with a vivid dream, although you would be forgiven for thinking it some form of vision. Sitting before you in his throne of power Bargrivyek. You are on your knees watching as the great deity uses his is magical energy to summon and destroy all manner of liquids in mid-air. Whilst his offhand twirls his iconic white-headed flail. He turns to you and speaks

> “Thnek, if you are to lead our people against the dwarves and ‘Make Goblins Great Again’, you need to expand your mind. Allow me to help.”

With a single snap of his fingers, you feel your mind fly open to new ideas, possibilities, a wealth of knowledge. You’re not sure what it is, but you feel almost receptive to information for a change, a flood of potential. You suddenly wake up.

Not wanting to waste this opportunity and a direct request from Bargrivyek himself, you run to the grand library and begin reading anything and everything you can get your little goblin mits on. It actually feels like you might be getting somewhere, you feel like the words start to stick together and make sense for a change. You are even tackling some of the more complex books, and even are pick up ‘The Entire History of Arcana’ by The Wise Alaundo. Needless to say, some of it is certainly lost on you, but you think you were able to absorb a good amount of it for a change!
