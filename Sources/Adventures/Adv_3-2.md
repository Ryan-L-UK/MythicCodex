# Solstice Shenanigans

## Adventure Background

The winter solstice is upon us, and Jack Frost has
arrived to the snow covered Gullet Cover for the celebration of Midwinter. Games, food, drink, and good
times are all promised in plenty, but it's not all fun and
games in the winter wonderland. Strange things are afoot
in the icy realm. Someone threatened the city, but not in the way you would expect.

# One Snowy Morning...

## Midwinter Is Upon Us

You awaken in the Scratching Post, your usual inn of choice for Gullet Cove. Outside a blanket of deep snow covers the city and those few souls walking the streets are wrapped up warm.

The scents of mulled cider and gingerbread wafting up from downstairs, warm and welcoming, it would appear that many townsfolk have come in to escape the cold. There's a dreamlike quality to the atmosphere, and much of the inn has been decorated in colour ribbons and small candles behind rainbow glass. Once the players gather read:

> An azure-skinned man with bright white, fabulously coifed hair, and a goatee resembling an icicle stands behind the bar. As you gather in the main room of the tavern, he watches with a smile. Once you've all gathered together, he addresses the everyone in the inn, "Welcome! Welcome and good morning! It is so nice of you to join us here. The name's Jack, and I look forward to seeing how each of you fare in todays games and festivities. I know the city is on a bit of a lockdown, but that’s no reason why we cant celebrate Midwinter\_. But I digress, would you all care to start your day with something to eat? Or perhaps a drink? Have a seat, and let me know what I can get you!"\*

(**Midwinter** also known as **Deadwinter Day** was a festival to mark the beginning of winter in Faerûn)

Jack appears to be a Water Genasi, with light blue skin and a white pompadour hair cut and a white pointed goatee. He is in fact Jack Frost, a powerful archfey and the event co-ordinator for these festivities. He will answer a few questions happily enough, though he will feign ignorance if his magic abilities or any lies are called into question (+17 Deception).

## Care For A Drink?

Jack has an impressive selection of drinks available, as well as whatever food the characters desire. Among the drinks on offer, Jack eagerly suggests Jack Daniels Whiskey, Yukon Jack Whisky (no E), Panama Jack or Calico Jack Rum, or Cactus Jack Tequila for those who want a harder beverage. As for ales, meads, and the like, he recommends Scrumpy Jack Cider, Deadeye Jack Porter, Thirsty Jack IPA, Black Jack Stout, Jack Rabbit Pale Ale, Jack's Pumpkin Spice Ale (quite popular with the young adventurers nowadays), or Honeyjack Mead. His top picks from the wine list are Blackjack Pasture, Jumpin Jack, and Black Jack. [ALL OF THESE ARE FREE TODAY]

## Food For Thought

The characters can learn the following during their initial visit and discussion with Jack:

- The Winter Games are in full swing. Listen for the barkers advertising their games around the city.
- You need at least 6 tokens to claim a prize, but there are 9 games out there, the more you collect the better the prize. If you collect all 9 you unlock the ‘Grand Prize’. All the prizes are a secret, but you are assured they are worth the effort.
- As an aside there was a surge of magical power recently, with some strange consequences. Jack encourages the characters to ask around about town.
- He is the orchestrator for all the games, and has been planning this since LAST midwinter. He will mention that same of the games have returned, but a few have not. The tree cutting contest, little sally lost an arm to the battle axe bully was swinging, and in the shock she dropped her battle axe on tiny tims foot. Now he needs crutches to walk.
- If the characters succeed an incredibly high perception/insight check, they will tell that jack is a little more magical than he seems to let on.

# The Games

## Game 1: Snowball Battle

After the characters have ﬁnished drinking and chatting with Jack, he will encourage them to leave the inn, and head to the first event. Read the following:

> As you step out of the warm interior of the tavern, a bitter wind nips at your noses. Shining ice and crystalline snow line the streets of Gullet Cove. Dozens of people pass by hurriedly, preparing for the celebration of the Midwinter. Some carry large, colorfully wrapped boxes, while others carry huge bags of food and drink. From the edge of town, you can hear a barker shouting in a gruﬀ voice, "Prove your mettle in a true test of skill! Try your aim in a snowball battle royale!"

The ﬁrst event of the celebration is an all-out free-for-all snowball battle. Weapons are prohibited on the ﬁeld of battle, which also functions as an antimagic ﬁeld. There's plenty of cover on the ﬁeld (see Map 1: Snowball Battleﬁeld), so remind your players to think tactically.

A male half-orc barker informs the characters of the rules of the battle, and facilitates the event.

> Moguns is a half-orc bard. He is the barker and referee in charge of the snowball fights. He's a simple man, but friendly and warm despite his gruff voice. Ginry (pronounced like "gin rye") is a Kenku Life Domain cleric with a level of druid for access to the goodberry spell. He makes his rounds between the snowball arena and the Field of Gifts, healing anyone who needs assistance. He frequently spouts non sequiturs vaguely related to the healing arts (e.g. "It's just a flesh wound!", "I'm not gonna make it, Sarge!", or "We need a medic!"). If the characters left the tavern without obtaining any knowledge from Jack himself, Ginry can also serve to provide some level of exposition to the characters by repeating things he has heard Jack tell other adventurers about the festivities.

### The Rules of Engagement

Snowballs can be thrown as an attack action, they are improvised ranged weapons (10/30ft) (1D20 + Dex - No Proficiency). You each start with 2, and it takes either a movement or attack action to make one.

Each player has 3 lives, if you are hit, you lose a life. When you run out you are out. The last character standing wins the battle and gets a prize.

(Add 1 townsfolk to the mix - but let the players win)

## Game 2: The Game Of Gifts

After the snowball battle, read the following:

> An elderly tiefling woman hands out piping-hot mugs of cocoa to the winner and losers alike. The taste is divine, and as you drink it you can feel the icy chill melt away. As you sip your hot cocoa while gearing back up and recovering from the grueling snowball battle, you hear a barker shouting out from another field, "Try your luck! Will it bite or will it bless? Who knows! Play the Game of Gifts and find out!"

The cocoa staves oﬀ the exhaustion from extreme cold for 1d4 hours. Next up is a high-stakes guessing game. A male gnome with wild hair and a glint in his eye runs it.

Gimble presents to the characters another large ﬁeld, on which there lies many large, colorfully wrapped gift boxes. Each character may purchase a turn to pick a present from the ﬁeld of gifts for 10 gp with each extra turn costing more unless the characters take Gimble up on a gamble. Twenty gifts dot the ﬁeld, but be warned, for ﬁve of them are actually gift mimics in disguise!

> Gimble Gemble the Gambler is the facilitator for the Game of Gifts. He is a charismatic warlock with an Archfey patron (Can you guess who?). If a character runs from a mimic, Gimble will use his eldritch blasts to send it to its holding cell. Being the gambler that he is, he will occasionally oﬀer extra picks to a character if they can successfully pick out a gift mimic on purpose.

If using physical maps, set up the field with the included tokens to flip over for each result. If you are using Theatre of the Mind, have each player roll a d20 to randomly pick a present (ignore and reroll repeats).

| D20 | Result                   |
| --- | ------------------------ |
| 1   | It's a Mimic!            |
| 2   | Aid (Spell)              |
| 3   | Bless (Spell)            |
| 4   | Frostbite (Spell)        |
| 5   | Melfs Acid Arrow (Spell) |
| 6   | It's a Mimic!            |
| 7   | Death Ward (Spell)       |
| 8   | It's a Mimic!            |
| 9   | Mind Spike (Spell)       |
| 10  | Armor of Agathys (Spell) |
| 11  | Fireball (Spell)         |
| 12  | +1 to all Damage Rolls   |
| 13  | It's a Mimic!            |
| 14  | Mass Cure Wounds (Spell) |
| 15  | +1 to Saving Throws      |
| 16  | +1 to Attack Rolls       |
| 17  | It's a Mimic!            |
| 18  | +1 to AC                 |
| 19  | +1 to Ability Checks     |
| 20  | 250GP                    |

Any effects will last for 8 hours or until dispelled.

If the gift grants a spell, the opener gains the ability to cast that spell once within the duration without expending a spell slot or requiring material components.

The DC for any spell that requires a saving throw is equal to 8 + the character's Charisma modifier + their Proficiency bonus, or their spell save DC if they are a caster.

If a mimic is discovered, it immediately makes one Pseudopod attack. A Gift Mimic magically teleports into a nearby holding cell as soon as it deals or has been dealt a total of 20 or more damage.

When players decide they are done with this game, they will be presented a ‘Win’ token from Gimble

## Game 3: Gnome Toppling

Whilst on the face of things the name is not a lie, you would expect this to be a game based around a gnome statue you have to knock over. Instead they appear to have paid a real live gnome to run around the arena in a ridiculous hat having large, slightly rotten apples thrown at them.

# Fabulous Firs

## Trees Do What Now?

After the characters return to the inn to claim their reward read the following:

> As you set back out into the town, you overhear a woman in a heated conversation with a member of the Golden Collar. "Right, it just walked out of your house then? You been drinkin' a bit too much egg nog again, Ruthie? Trees ain't got legs, an' they don't move on their own. You pro'ly ne'er even 'ad a tree to begin with." With that, the constable walks off shaking his head. The woman flips him off, then turns around to face the party. "Oh, well, uh, you didn't see nothin' there, right? But have you seen my Solstice tree? It... sort of... wandered off."

Ruth goes on to explain how her fully decorated Solstice tree just picked up its roots and knocked down her door. She informs the party that several other households have experienced the same phenomenon, but the guards aren't taking any of them seriously. She offers the party a nice old-fashioned home-cooked meal if they agree to figure out what's going on and return the trees.

The evidence left behind by the tree's departure is as expected, an assortment of decorations that quite clearly fell off during the egress, as well as a few smaller branches and a boat load of pine needles. They can find some clues in her home after eating a nice old-fashioned homecooked meal. A detect magic spell will register a lingering aura of transmutation around the planter the tree was housed in prior to its egress.

If a character succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, they find evidence that Ruth was telling the truth—marks in the splintered door appear to have been made by the ornamented branch of a pine tree.

If a character succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check, they can pick up the trail and follow it out into the woods. Once in the woods, another Wisdom (Survival) check (DC 15 this time) is necessary to follow the path of the tree into the woods.

## The Talk Of The Town

As the characters leave ruths house they will soon discover that nearly all of the decorated Solstice trees have gone missing, though not all as violently as Ruth's.

- Mabel's tree came to life while they were decorating it and nearly gave her husband a heart attack.
- Ethel's tree absconded in the middle of the night and left nothing but a few pine needles leading to the chimney.
- Petunia's tree leaped out of a second story window into a passing wagon, and she swears it performed a rude gesture with its branches somehow.
- Whiskers even claims that their tree actually started a fight with them before making a break for the door. During their escape whiskers tackled the tree into the lit fire place. Which through a series of unfortunate events caused their entire house to burn down.

# On The Trail

## To The Graveyard...

All the various routes lead across town to the graveyard which is a large area lined with a variety of trees. You follow a trail of tinsel, decorations and pine needles through the snow across the town and you will find an area of the graveyard occupied by several fully decorated pine trees. If any character approaches within 5 feet of the trees, they animate immediately and reveal themselves to actually be 4 Awakened Solstice Trees. Unless the characters have explicitly stated that they expect the trees to be animate before this point, the characters are surprised for the first round of combat.

From within the branches of the nearest tree, you hear a voice call out, "Death to the fleshy ones! Spill their blood to water our roots!"

The awakened Solstice trees make the most of their Dazzling Ornamentation trait and gang up on any character affected by it. It's not the end of the adventure if the party is defeated at this point, so feel free to really go all out against your players and work out any aggression you have towards any of them. One defeated all the will remain is splinters of wood, some ruined decorations and a lot of pine needles, you think you will be finding them for weeks.

## The Blighted Caves

The party can follow the trail of tinsel (Survival DC 12) back to a collection of rather old gravestones. One of the graves is a small building with a stone door which has been smashed open. Inside a stairwell can be found which seems to lead down to a cave system deep underground. When the characters reach the caves, read the following:

> After about an hour of trailing after tinsel, you arrive at an opening in the face of a mountain deep in the woods. More tinsel, along with various ornamentation, hangs haphazardly across it. Broken wooden toys lay scattered about. A group of three colorful coniferous humanoids is currently patrolling the area around the cave entrance. It seems likely this cave leads to the source of this whole kerfuffle. The characters will now have to fight the 10 Festive Needle Blights if they wish to proceed into the cave. If they are quiet enough, they might be able to take out the first group of 3 at the mouth of the tunnels without immediately alerting the 7 others further in. After the party defeats the initial ten blights, read the following: As the rush of combat fades from your senses and you venture forth into the cave, you hear what sounds like the rustling of leaves and shuffling of branches coming from further within the cave system. To your right, a short tunnel leads to a rickety looking bone-crafted cage that is currently empty, though it looks to have seen its fair share of prisoners. Ahead of you lies darkness, as well as whatever is behind these disturbances.

## We Need To Go Deeper

As the characters progress further into the caves, the light fades entirely until it is pitch black. The party will find the remaining Needle Blights each can be encountered or avoided on the way to the main chamber of the cave system (their locations are marked on Map 5). The cave is cold and damp, and has a smell of really old pine, almost going bad/rotting level pine. When the characters finally reach the central chamber, read the following:

> As you descend yet another ramp and round yet another bend in the tunnel, the warm glow of a fire can be seen coming from a chamber ahead. As you approach, you see the tunnel opens up into a large circular chamber. A large bonfire burns in the center of the chamber, while a menagerie of animated trees and blights seemingly dance around the flickering flames, emitting a strange sound that almost sounds like language, but there's something not quite right about it. You briefly wonder about the ethical ramifications of animated trees burning what are essentially the corpses of its fallen brethren. Wow, these trees are messed up.

Dancing around the bonfire are several awakened trees and a few needle blights. They appear to be chanting and are in general unaware of the whole situation with the players and could be surprised.

# The Final Showdown

After the characters defeat this last group of plants, read the following:

> From a hidden alcove, a voice cries out, "What have you done!? You've killed them! You've killed them all! I was saving them from a slow death trapped inside away from nature, and you killed them anyway! You worthless sacks of excrement and meat! You will pay for your folly!"
>
> At that moment, the fire in the center of the room flares brightly, spreading out in an instant to consume the corpses of the plant creatures in a flash. Suddenly the cavern fills with a crackling laugh... and the delicious fragrant aroma of roasting chestnuts.
>
> An elf draped in rotting leathers studded with gnarly chunks of bones and teeth emerges from the shadows. He wields a long staff that appears to have been carved from the femur of a large humanoid, and a dull black shield that seems to absorb the light around him. He is flanked by one of the colorful blights. His eyes glow with an intense hatred as he levels his gaze at the party, "Oh yes... You. Will. Pay."
>
> Suddenly, from what was seemingly a once normal bonfire walks a fire elemental, as the elf upon his raised shelf starts laughing manically.

Eluyeta Hyllaerrion begins hostile towards the characters, and will attack them on his turn during initiative, as will the Chestnuts-Roasting-On-An-Open- Fire Elemental.

It is possible for the characters to attempt to pledge that they are sympathetic to Eluyeta's cause by spending an action on their turn to attempt a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check if they are genuine or a DC 20 Charisma (Deception) check if they are just trying to buy time. If they succeed, Eluyeta will stay his hand, for the time being, so that matters can be discussed further.

Eluyeta's demands are rather extreme, however, and the characters are unlikely to come to an agreement with him. His demands are as follows:

- The people of the town must agree to never cut down and decorate the corpse of another tree, under punishment of death.
- For each tree that was cut down, he demands one humanoid limb from the townsfolk.
- One young adult humanoid must be presented on a yearly basis to Eluyeta's cave for him to affix to a post, decorate with barbed tinsel and hooked ornaments, and be provided with nothing but water until death.

If the characters actually agree to Eluyeta's demands, they'll get lynched when they get back to town; and honestly, we will need to stop to to talk about what this means for the rest of the campaign.

## After the Battle

If Eluyeta and his Chestnuts-Roasting-On-An-Open-Fire Elemental are defeated, the characters can recover his belongings, among which is a journal filled with pages upon pages about the plight of the Solstice trees.

## Loot

- 1 Gem worth 300 gp.
- 1 Gem worth 500gp (Very hard to find).

# The Heroes Return

## The Prize Giving Ceremony

Upon the defeat of Eluyeta, they will be free to loot the cave where they will find a variety of solstice decorations littering the cave. They are free to progress on as they see fit, but overall there will be nothing further of note in the cave.

Upon making their way back to town they will find a variety of the townsfolk will be waiting around for an update from the adventurers. There is no benefit or drawback for this, it would just be interesting to see what they come up with as things go.

Upon returning to the inn, you find a big crowd of people all waiting for the prize giving ceremony, also possibly for the free Jack-Related beverages, you’re unsure, but never the less, the place is packed. As you walk in Jack offers a round of applause to the team with the most tokens, yourselves. He beacons you up onto the stage to claim your prize, but not before acknowledging the extra work you have done with helping solve the mystery of the missing trees.

As you all line up upon the stage jack begins his speech.

> My Dear Friends, welcome to the scratching post for this the celebration of Midwinter. As you all know we have a friendly competition each year with prizes up for grabs! Now I do hope you all enjoyed the games, there were a few new ones to replace some of the err, well lets just say, some of the less successful ones!
>
> Now here we have upon the stage the winners of this years Midwinter games, and for the first time ever a team has claimed all 9 winners tokens. So my friends I present to you the top prize, something truly special and incredibly rare.
>
> A small table is placed at the front of the stage with a red silk cloth over it. Jack being the showman he is, builds a little tension and dramatically removes the cloth and revealing 6 large candle jars with lids, each filled with white wax. The label on the outside is old and tatty and has clearly seen many winters. The label reads: ‘Illithid Candle’
>
> Jack is excited and starts to present each of you one by one with a candle, addressing the inn as he does so: “As the grand prize winners, I gift each of you these incredibly rare Illithid candles.” Jack is paused for a moment as a murmuring starts emanating from the crowd gathered in the inn, before the sound is broken by a drunkard at the back calling: ‘whats an ill-thud?’
>
> Jack pauses for a moment: “Ah yes of course, in Faerûn you know illithids by a different name, Mind Flayers”. The Crowd gasps a little.
>
> Finally getting the reaction he wanted, Jack continues: “Legend goes that the wax for these 6 candles was collected thousands of years ago from deep within the Mind Flayer City from the ruler of the mind flayers, the Elder Brain. But whilst interesting, thats not the exciting bit about these candles. The true excitement happens when you remove the lid“
>
> With a single wave of his hand, the lid of each candle falls to the floor and the wax is exposed to the air for the first time. A stale and musky smell fills your lungs as if these jars haven’t been opened in a millennia.
>
> As you try to take your next breath, you falter for a moment and you feel your mind under siege from something. You blink a few times, as you gasp again trying to grab your next breath. Something is in your mind, combing through it, searching for something, a memory, or a feeling, its hard to say, but it also isnt your primary focus right now. As you attempt your third breath, you feel a snap and the combing instantly releases, as if it found what its looking for. You take a deep breath and your breathing returns to normal again and with it, you each exchange looks to confirm you all experienced the same thing.
>
> But during these exchanges you hear gasps from the crowd. You look down to see that your candle is changing colour before your very eyes, and the smell is changing along with it. Jack Smiles and says: “each candle is based upon your personality and is tailored towards each of you. Enjoy my friends, and happy Midwinter”.
