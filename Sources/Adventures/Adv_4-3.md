# The Skull Square Murders

## Adventure Background

Volothamp Geddarm is trying to get his hands on a key that will
purportedly allow entrance to ahghairon’s tower. Ahghairon’s tower, where
the first open lord of Faerun is entombed, is secured by a force cage and
other spells and traps that keep people out and the mysterious treasures
that Ahghairon laid there safe. However, both the Xanathar and Bregan
D’Aerthe want the key and to eliminate their rivals.

This plot plays out against the backdrop of skullport, the small square
just top the east of Waukeens Promenade. A long-time resident, the mind
flayer Yraxilinith accidentally ate the brain of the wrong person. Rather
than start a murderous feud with the Zhentarim, it made a deal to recover
the key for them. Past that, it just wants to be left in peace to raise
show-quality intellect devourers.

# An Interesting Introduction

> You walk through the streets following your brief time with the cult of Ouroboros, each of you is lost in thought, all different thoughts, but lost none the less. It’s actually somewhat of a shock as one of you bumps into a very well dressed human. You stagger backwards and land on your arse on the floor.

Before you stands Volothamp Geddarm (Volo) a widely travelled sage and
wizard. He is the realms "go-to-guy" even if his information is,
at best, only half-accurate.

- He bows deeply, and greets the party with a 'Well met, friends, allow me
  to introduce myself, I am Volothamp Geddarm'.
- It is at this moment he notices the party member on the floor and
  apologies profusely before helping them to their feet. He then casts
  Prestidigitation to clean them. and flavours them subtlety of mint.
- As an apology he insists they join him at The Silver Sovereign, his
  favourite of all the inns for a drink, his treat.

## At The Inn

- Volo leads you to a corner table where he attempts to try not to draw
  much attention to himself.
- The inn keeper, Zel (and secret member of the Xanathar Guild), sullenly
  washes dishes behind the bar, whilst a particularly rowdy and raucous
  crew of Tieflings laughs, jokes and throws dice in the corner.

**_Objectives/Goals._** Volo wants to hire the heroes to
recover a stolen key (truthfully, it’s not stolen, Volo just wants it)
engraved with a gold dragon that he claims allows entrance into
Ahghairon’s Tower. Ahghairon’s Tower was formerly the home of the great
wizard who was the first lord of the Moonshae Isles and has been sealed by
magic for generations. Volo has rented rooms here for the heroes and asks
them to go find the key and get it at any cost. He promises to include
them in any exploration of Ahgharion’s Tower (“There’s wealth there beyond
your wildest dreams, my dearest friend, but we need the key first!”).
Truth be told, Volo hasn’t got a large amount of cash to give the
adventurers at the moment. Zel wants to hear what the heroes are doing so
he can report it back to The Xanathar. The Tieflings want to be left
alone.  
 **_What Do They Know?_** Volo knows that the key was last seen
in the new Seilf Emit the Pawn Shop. He urges the heroes to recover the
key—giving them specific instructions on how to find the pawn shop, as
well as a picture of the key itself. Volo also knows that Ahghairon's
Tower is a about half a day’s walk north of the city. He knows the way.
Zel knows about Sielf Emit the Pawn Shop, and that people have been
turning up dead and gruesomely murdered around Skull Square which makes
the community nervous. The Tieflings know that they normally hang out in
Skull Square, but they haven’t been lately because of the murders. They
only go as a large pack.  
 **_Murders?_** Adventurers may wonder why this is the first
time they are hearing of these horrific murders, and its simple because
the town guard have been trying to keep it under wraps. They don’t want
the town going into panic after only just getting back to normal after the
violence from the siege. But like anything, you can’t keep something like
this under wraps for long, townsfolk talk, and rumours only grow.

### Note

If pressed for money up front, Volo will take great offence and leave. He
had offered a chance for a quest to a great place, but the gread and desire is too much for him.

# Opportunity Lost

> Volo stands up, he appears visibly upset. In a stern voice he says: "This is what I was worried about. It would seem all you care about is money, rather than helping those around you. And I don’t have time for this"
>
> With this he stands up from his seat, muttering a few words as he does so. He turns sharply, causing his cloak to bellow out behind him. Just when he has his back to you, you hear a loud crack, and he disappears entirely before your eyes. As he does so there is a very noticeable rush air around you, frantically trying to fil the void where Volo once stood. Upon the floor you find a single parchment exactly where volo was previously standing. It reads:
>
> "I hope that this teaches you that life is worth living. That it is not all about gold, but instead about the thrill of adventure. I leave you with just enough to get by, and in time, I hope you will see the favour I have done for you. One day soon I will seek you out to see if you have learned your lesson, then, and only then, will I return what I have taken.
>
> Signed Volo"

## Think Carefully

> It would seem your overly keen desire for a 'reward' has cost you the opportunity of adventure on this occasion, and with it, any hope of visiting the hidden tower volo spoke of. You each notice your coin pouches have also been emptied. A quick glance and a count reveals you are each left with a total of 10 gold pieces, perhaps next time you may think more carefully about your approach.
