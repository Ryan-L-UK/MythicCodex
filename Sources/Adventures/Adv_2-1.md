  - These will be tainted and should be treated as a poison if they are consumed ain any way. (1d6 poison damage per snort)

## The Tent

- The market area has been covered with a giant tent which spans the entire market place. A multicoloured magic fabric sparkles and lights the inside.
- Looking up from the inside, the entire top of the tent is bewitched with a variety of magical effects and lights. It looks like the night sky with dancing lights, sparkles and magical fireworks cascading through the air.
- Inside the regular market stalls can be found, along with some new and exciting ones.
  - **Hometown Hook -** fish stall, with magical cooling units keeping the fish fresh. Owned by Brume Copperwelt, a halfling with a huge belly and a pipe never out of his lips.
  - **The Night's Brooch -** A small, mobile cart selling jewellery, particularly pearls pressed into seashells. Owned by Felicity Flop, a tiny cat who tinkles when she moves, her ginger fur braided with dozens of gems.
  - **Smell My Posy -** A small flower stand, with artfully arranged bouquets of roses, delicately laced with dried seaweed. Owned by McIvor Glistenhame, a half-elf with a constant frown of concentration.
  - **Nip & Tuck** – Shares a table with Smell My Posy, and specialises in legal drugs and narcotics. These will be tainted and if asked where they got it from they will just say they bought a crate from the harbour masters seller and look very terrified if threatened.
  - **The Copper Pitcher -** A bric-a-brac stand, with dozens of different items all in differing states of disrepair. Owned by Oakie Thompson and Mokie Thompson; a pair of twin spaniels who finish each other’s sentences.
  - **Souvenirs** - A stall selling artfully crafted hats and cloaks for dogs and cats, each woven or knitted from the finest of fabrics. Owned by Oshe, a large brown labrador with only one ear. These are all themed for the event.
  - **Blacksmith: The Fighter's Sword** – A twin pair of labs run the blacksmith. Hammer & Anvil. There is only half a brain cell between them. They have been selling decorative weapons today, but they do have a few ‘Silver’ weapons. They also offer to silver weapons, or 10 ‘ammo’ for 100gp.
  - **Spot The Mimic** – 1Gp to play, 10Gp if you find the mimic in a variety of random objects. Perception/Investigation 15. The mimic is perfectly tame.
  - **Timory’s Shipyard Wonders** – 5Sp to ride, and it’s a catapult that shoots you into the air and catches you again, but you are able to fly through the magical sky at the top of the tent. Roll a D20 to see if someone takes damage from the splinter caused the day before.
  - A fortune-teller who uses divination magic to actually tell your fortune.
  - A few shops are sadly closed, and it would appear they have been for some time, the recession has hit hard everywhere. Some of the names do catch your eye. ‘The Screaming Hog’, ‘The Calm Train’ & ‘Florist Gump’ to name a few.

## The Main Event

- Several cages can be seen, they are partially covered with a black sheet but you can see in side and they appear empty. There are LOTS of guards blocking the way with a staff only sign, and instructions that no one is to go on the stage unless they are the guest of honour himself.
- Before players try to enter the pet shop secret location. The guest of honour will arrive on his dog and there will be the big cheer and a lot of excitement.
- He will walk onto the stage and dismount the dog who will sit at attention off to the side.
- There will be a big charismatic speech of the journey through the many seas. He will talk of the struggles, the days that went by where urine was the only drink they had. Essentially tales of torment and woe. Until at last they landed on a new island, inhabited by a brand new species.
- Like David Copperfield, there will be the big reveal as the cloaks are draped back over the three large cages and with some magical sparks, the cloaks will be removed to reveal three cages one with a fully grown Tabaxi, another with an Aarakocra and the third with a Harengon.
- Gasps and oohs will be heard from the audience, along with protests from the respective animals.

## The Ship (The Serpent’s Cry)

#### The Crew In General

- Most of the crew will be ashore at this point. What crew remain appear to be the unlucky few who need to stay and man the ship ensuring she is ready to go at a moments notice.
- They will appear pleased to be in port, but upset they will miss the celebrations.
- Advise the captain can be found in his cabin, but warn that he can be a little, much.
- They will also advise of the bonus he gave all the crew for their hard work on this voyage, and that most of the crew have gone ashore, no doubt most will return penniless.

#### The Captains Cabin

- Upon knocking there will be a lot of barking.
- Monsieur Le-Furr (Le-Fair) can be found sat behind his chair at his desk, quill in hand counting coins with the first mate.
- He is a fat white cat with a pair of black spots around his eyes. His hat is huge, with a giant feather. He looks over a set of crescent moon glasses perched upon the end of his nose. With the most ornate purple captains jacket you have ever seen.
- Glenn is a pretty normal looking human, a little smaller than average. His eyes bloodshot as if he hasn’t slept in a while, but overall in fair shape. Whilst he may not be the captain, you would be willing to bet he has done a fair amount of work as the captain.
- Sir Barks-A-Lot is a tall, non-awakened Doberman, with a look constant stern look and a serious case of resting ‘I will fuck you up’ face.
- He will instruct that all loyal fans should away him at the tent for the celebrations.
- If questioned on the death of his crew member, he will just suggest they clearly done too much of stuff they shouldn’t, and that there is nothing wrong with their goods, and to stop spreading false rumours.
  - He will provide a small sample he has stashed in his office for later, and it will be perfectly fine and not tampered with.
- If there is nothing else, they should go to the tent he will be along shortly for the celebrations as he has a big surprise for everyone. A new species has been discovered.

# The Drug Fuel

## Murder On The Docks

- A fat gnome will be found on the dock by the harbourmaster. He is the Harbourmasters assistant and you remember him from your arrival looking a little, shady. But given some people just have that look, you paid him no real attention.
- He is dead and with foam coming from the mouth. His face quite puffy, although given his stature its hard to say if that’s the cause of death, or just one too many doughnuts.
- On his body you will find a note in his pocket, as well as a small coin pouch with 2 gold coins in it, all covered in a curious dust. What ever poison was on this page was slow acting enough that he likely didn’t know he was poisoned until it was too late.
- The note is from the cunning man advising of the fact that the cut was meant to make animals a little more menial, not a little more dead. That he has displeased the cunning man, and that he will pay the price.
- On the back will be the faint writing of an old closed up shop in the market place. ‘The Calm Train’
- A closer look of the man will also reveal a death certificate for a dog, and on the other side, a note written and signed by the dog.

## The Calm Train

- Will be closed up tight and there will be a sign saying out of business on the door. The paper looks similar to that of the note you have. There is a further sign saying deliveries round the back.
- A very flimsy looking door is round the back which is unlocked and entry is granted easily to a back room of the establishment.
- The smell of old tobacco and smokable cat nip fills your lungs. You start to understand where the name ‘Calm Train’ came from.
- After a short look around, a cupboard will reveal a stair way down underneath the calm train. An initial glance at the walls suggest that this is a feature added after the closure of the Calm Train. The tunnel has been carved out of the rock by hand and would have taken a fair amount of time. So whoever has done this, clearly had a good reason too.
- The tunnel appears to have been carved from the very rock itself, fairly recently. There are no stairs, simple a slope tunnel down.

## The Pet Shop

- The tunnel is dark, reducing visibility to 5 feet.
- DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check enables the player characters to hear a heated conversation ahead of them, where the darkness of the tunnel is replaced by a glint of light.
- One of the voices is raging, demanding immediate violence. The other is calming and is attempting to ask the first voice to be calm and to trust him.
- You see two figures leave the bar area at the bottom of the stars. A tall well-built human and a small dwarf.
- In the central room and auction is taking place with over 30 various clients all sat in the tables being served drinks by waiters and waitresses in rather revealing attire.
- The clients appear to be a variety of races, however none appear awakened animals. The are all dressed in amazingly fabulous attire, however each wears a ornate and elaborate mask. The mask covers their whole head and each appears to be a different mythical creature.
- The bidding will begin on a rather small scared looking puppy, and there will be low numbers, 2’s, 3’s & 4’s. It is actually in the hundreds of gold pieces.
- Four goblin guards are stationed at various points around the main cave, with one behind the bar.
- Inside the cage A large dog can be seen, the father of the puppy up for auction, as well as two small cats. All appear visibly distressed and not happy to be here. The dog holds on to the ‘death certificate’ of his wife.

### A Fight Breaks Out

- As soon as combat is looming, the Cunning Man will announce loudly:

> My deepest apologies, we will have to forgo todays sales. Please brace for immediate departure

- The goblin behind the bar can be seen smashing a piece of glass covering some form of button. Once this button is pressed, what appears to be an arcane liquid is dropped from the ceiling upon each of the clients. The moment it touches them they immediately blink out of existence.
- The cunning man will make a leaping dive to the nearest one to also make his escape, leaving behind Requin. The random person will appear disgusted at being touched by the Cunning Man.
- Requin won’t flee, no matter the circumstances. He fights with reckless abandon, enjoying himself intensely. He will also turn into his wereshark almost instantly. The goblins provide support to the wereshark, but he leads the combat, snapping at the player characters with his vast jaws or bludgeoning them with the anchor he carries everywhere.
- Upon his defeat he does need to be stabbed with something silver ideally, if the party have worked that out. If not, he may come back at a later date, who is to say.
- Upon his death he will return to a (dead) version of his human form.

## The Loot

#### The Goblins:

- Jar Of Pickled Toes -> A common goblin delicacy
- Pocket of sand -> To throw at enemies
- Various coin purses -> 23 CP
- A standard dagger

#### Requin

- Coin Purse -> 10GP
- Note of thanks for all his hard work, signed by ‘The Cunning Man’

#### The Pet Shop

- Small stash of paperwork (various death certificates)
- A book can be found entitled ‘Prophecies Of The Wise’
- Inside a book, a page will be marked. Entirely blank, except these words:
- The Lord of Murder shall perish. But in his doom he shall spawn a score of mortal progeny. Chaos will be sown from their passing, So sayeth the wise Alaundo.
- A check will reveal knowledge that Alaundo was a seer many years ago in the sword coast, but he is known to have travelled the world, it seems only plausible that his work would have made its way here.
- Order Forms For Animals

#### Special Items

- _[Pot Of Awakening](http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Pot%20Of%20Awakening.png)_
- _[Charlatan's Die](http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Charlatan's%20Die.png)_

#### Freeing The Captives

- Freeing the animals will of course cheer the various animals up, except the father dog, Maximus, who will be holding on to the death certificate of his wife. He will explain that they write out the death certificates of the animals to explain their disappearance.
- The death certificate will be signed in the Cunning Mans true name. Gadrin Hillbane.

# A Return To The Surface

## The Calm Before The Storm

- Just as you left it, the Calm Train will be quiet, although impossible to seal shut after you splintered the door into a million pieces with a 1 inch punch.
- The area of the Market will still have a variety of people in it, although most will have dispersed now that the show from Le-Furr is over.
- The stalls will be there, although given the lack of custom, most will also be closing up at this point.
- But this is not the end of the merriment. A short while later a canon shot can be heard. It would appear that your companion, Kerwyn (Kirsty), headed back to the ship, freed the three captives and they have taken it upon themselves to get some revenge. By shooting canons at the Serpents Cry.
- The ship would appear to have made a somewhat of a hasty exit to the sea, however it is now under fire from one of the larger and more special of the of the cannons on the edge of the harbour.

## The Warehouse

- Little more in here can be found than general store of stock.
- Hidden behind one of the crates on the upper story however is a small barrel of catnip, along with a bag of what appears to be, various poisons. This is clearly where the gnome was blending the Narcotics with something more sinister.

## The Breakout

### The Serpents Cry

- Manned by a skeleton crew, but still enough to make way. There are various people on and around the ship
  - Monseur LeFurr is in his cabin. He is initially shouting at Glenn before banishing him.
  - Glenn will leave the captains quarters before heading down
  - Below decks two crew members will be seen patrolling the cannons. Dainard 'Brown-eyes' Acton & Wiley 'Dead Eyes' Blakemore
  - Down in the bilge at the bottom will be the three cages and a single half-orc on guard. She will be asleep, with the keys in hand. Nex.
- You can escape be incapacitating all the guards, you can escape through one of the canon port holes. You can also escape by fighting your way out.
- Potentially spotted by the lookout on the ship, depending on the stealth.
  - If spotted the captain will be notified
  - He will come on deck to find crew in various conditions.
  - Glenn will try to hide as he knows he will get beaten for this.
- The Triple gun is one of Timorys prized ideas and comprised of three large cannons mounted on a rotating gearing system. Once fired, the cannon recoils and the gearing automatically rotates to the next. This allows the spend cannon to be reloaded whilst two shots remain chambered. Used to protect the harbour from Men-O-War, it would appear to be making mincemeat of the Serpents Cry.
- Ptolemeow (Aaron) Will very much like this design and im sure would love the opportunity to copy it.
- The harbour master will rush with 2 human members of the watch to stop them, however between the Aarakocra, is able to fend off the watch, who decide that this really isn’t worth their time, and much to the distress of the harbour master, walk off.
- The tabaxi will be casting spells like a trooper and monsieur lefurr will be fighting back. Check the character sheets for her stats.
- You can only imagine how upset this must be making Monsieur LeFurr.

# The Scratching Post

- Inside The Inn
- A little quieter inside, less sailers and nautical vibes than the previous night.
- A few people can talk about the random appearance of some dwarf who appeared out of thin air.
- They will say he looked concerned and shocked, but seemed to run off in the direction of some back streets.
  - If on the chance the party try searching for him, the smell will have gone by now thanks to the overwhelming smell of gunpowder.
  - They will not there were lots of various routes and double backs to ensure he wasn’t followed.
- The inn ALREADY has (A Dog) talent on the stage, a bardic rhyme battle can be carried out.

> The scent of the room as you entered is unbelievable,  
> How I didn’t vomit on my lute, is inconceivable.  
> You think yourself wise to stand upon my stage,  
> But I have just started, consider a disengage.  
> Is there any cat nip in the house, for my friend, he looks nervous,  
> Although given his tiny stature, it’s a wonder he gets service.  
> My Friend, re-evaluate your life and your existence,  
> I bet you talk a good game, but can you go the distance…
