# The Sleep Of The Dreamless

## The Gates Of Horn & Ivory

> You all awaken, with somewhat of a start. But you are not where you once were. You all respectively open you eyes, and where the should be rafters and a thatch roof, you see nothing but a star filled sky with ornate green and blue nebula's. The air around you has a certain chill about it. You each shudder slightly in the cold. There is no smell discernible smell, and the only sound is ocean lapping the shoreline. As each of you sit up to survey the area, it is clear this isnt Gullet Cove, and its not the Sword Coast, you are not even sure if this is the terrestrial plane any more. Before you stands a city wall. Although this is like nothing you have every seen before. The wall stands over 50 feet high and is made of a white crystalline brick. In the centre a giant circle opening. The words ‘The Gates of Horn & Ivory’ are etched into the stone above the doors. There is sadly little left of the doors themselves. They appear to have been smashed to pieces by something big.

## The Librarian Awaits

- The door is directly in front of you, but there is little else around the entrance to the dreaming. You stand upon a grey small sandy beach which meets the ocean. The ocean itself consist of blue and purple waters and appears to expand indefinitely to the horizon. Either side of the door and wall giant rock faces climb hundreds of feet into the air, limiting you to two options, the doorway, or the ocean. The ocean appears calm and still, but the waters are far from clear, and who knows what manner of foul creatures may be found lurking in the deep.
- Standing before you is a Drow called **[Lucienne](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Lucienne.png)** Unlike standard Drows, Lucienne will actually be quite amenable and helpful. You feel like whilst she is a Drow, its more likely due to the lack of sunlight, than anything else.
- The pathway appears to split in three separate directions, with each signposted.
  - Left: The City Of Dreams. (Perception: Smoke is rising from the city)
  - Middle: The Forest of the sleepless.
  - Right: The Palace of Nightmares.

## Lucienne

> Welcome friends to the Dreaming. Most of you will have visited before, although on saying that i see we have Felidae among us. Welcome my friends to the Dreaming, the Welcoming Dark no doubt misses you. My name is Lucienne, and I am the curator of the great library in the Palace Of Dreams. I have called you here because I require your assistance…The Lord of Dreams has gone missing.Owndership of the dreaming is divided between the Lord Of Dreams, and the Prince of Nightmares, and i assure you, there have been many conflicts between them. They often meet every few years within the Forest Of The Sleepless to discuss various terms to avoid an all out war. Previous agreements have consisted of the usual things:

- Nightmare is allowed to inflict suffering on XX% of the population.
- And Dream wont crush nightmare into PASTE like the insects he is.
- You know, standard things.

However at the last one of these, Nightmare was somewhat displeased with the agreement, suggesting they should be allowed more freedom in the dream plane to inflict suffering on as many people as they saw fit. Naturally Dream shut this down immediately and each went their own way, spitting venom, as they did so. An in the case of Nightmare, quite literally. .

Allow some time here for questions. As I imagine there will be some.

> The plane of dreams is one of many planes of existence. We border both the terrestrial plane, and the celestial plane. This allows dreamers to come and go from this plane freely at night, before taking the great ship back to the terrestrial plane when their visit is over. In the past there have been conflicts fought between both the Dream and Celestial planes. It is the will of certain celestials to walk among the free folk, with the intention of oppressing them. Not all of them mind, but over the centuries they have created a sizable faction. So, to defend both us, and the terrestrial plane, Dream created various layers of defence to prevent them from gaining access, which includes these very gates. But now the Lord of dreams has gone missing, the dream plane and everything he built has started to crumble to ruins.

## The Tasks

- Eradicate the Celestials
- Find the Lord Of Dreams
- Find out of the Prince Of Nightmares is somehow involved.

## The Reward

- The favour of the Lord Of Dreams.
- Helping in the defence of the terrestrial plane from rogue celestials.
- And the most important, the ability to go home, as i can only summon you, I can not send you home, only dream can do that.

## One Last Point

> In the Dream Plane things are often not what they seem, and whilst the world may be crumbling there are many dreamers still here. For the dreamers they see only what they want to see, imagination is a wonderful thing, taking the mundane and making it amazing. You on the other hand will see things for what they really are. It is also worth noting that you are but ghosts to the dreamers, they can hear you, and interact with you, but like people in your own dreams. They are perceived as little more than a figment of the imagination. Also whilst we are on the subject of imagination, it is worth mentioning that should a dreamer die, their body disappears and the dreamer awakens exactly where they went to sleep. However in your case, it is not that simple. I have summoned you here, so these bodies, are your actual bodies. Which means not only is the magic real and your weapons sharp, the ability to die is also a possibility.

# The Theatre Of Dreams

- There are a variety of Dreamers within the Theatre, all be it, the theatre itself will have seen better days.
- All will be still except a **[Dryad](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Dryad.png)** who will be found wandering around the main theatre, they will die if court, but they will point to the hedge maze.
- The **[Dryad](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Dryad.png)** will be making their way towards the hedge maze, which will spark the test.

## The Labyrinth Of The Eternals

How To Play The Labyrinth

> Outside I have placed a copy of the maze, with arrows highlighting a path to the centre. It isnt necessarily the quickest path to the centre, but if you follow every arrow, it will get you to the centre non the less. Each of you will be sent out one by one and will be allowed 20 seconds from the minute you leave the table to look at the map and memorise as much as you can. When the time is up, you must come back to the table and describe the route to the rest of the team, then based on your instructions, they will map it out on the page. YOU are not allowed to touch the page yourself, this is a test of both your memory and communication skills. When you have remembered or more appropriately forgotten as much as you can, the next person can go, and we continue until you have found a path to the centre. If we run out of time, we will pause and pick up where we left off next session.

(No cheating!)

- Two maps, a plain gird, and the real map.
- Real map is placed in another room, plain on the table and they much draw the route.

## Encounter

- Inside the centre of the maze will be:
  - 2 x **[Dryad](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Dryad.png)**
  - 1 x **[Awakened Tree](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Awakened%20Tree.png)**
- Inside a magical glass container will also be dream, he will have been cuffed with a magical vine, and gagged with poison ivy. His eyes will be bloodshot and he will be in considerable pain from what ever they have done with him.
- You will find the **[Awakened Tree](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Awakened%20Tree.png)** trying to extract answers from dream on how to get to the waking world. But dream will not be budging on the matter.
- One of the **[Dryad](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Dryad.png)**s will also be trying to eat some form of pie and will ask for more wine. Demanding they hurry as this pie is dry.

## The Loot

- Antler Headdress
- [Blood Lily Flower](http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Blood%20Lily%20Flower.png)
- [Wooden Compass](http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Compass%20of%20Alignment.png)
- White Sapling
- Dream will offer a number of carats. With more if they can deal with price of nightmares

## Releasing Dream

- Dream will be happy about his release and thank the party, although will be visibly angry about the situation. He will also ask who sent him and commend that **[Lucienne](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Lucienne.png)** has always looked out for him.
- He will offer no more insight aside from being sure this has something to do with the disagreement with Nightmare.
  - He will explain that nightmare wanted control of the theatre of dreams, and the autonomy to torture dreamers.
  - Not just limited to the torture nightmares provide, but actually allow his demons to torture dreamers.
  - Dream did not stand for this and demand that nightmare stick to previous agreement, or suffer dreams wrath.
  - This threat is probably what has caused all the issues.
- He himself will not be able to do much as he is took weak and must repair the damage the celestials have done to the dreaming. Sending the party to go and deal with them. If they have already dealt with the situation the party should explain at this point.
- He will offer them a chance to take a rest if they need it.
  - He will get to experience the forest of the dreamless, an honour few dreamers get to visit.

# The Forest Of The Sleepless

- The Squirrel A squirrel jumps in front of your party. He wags his tail and tries to lead the party. If they ignore him, he will throw acorns at them until he can get them to follow him. After a short while of following they will find a Firbolg Finasaer Mithanmyr who has been caught by a hunting trap and is clearly hurt. A demon will have laid the trap, you can tell as its black, rusty and smoking strangely. But there would appear to be no good reason why. Following the squirrel will also bring them to the edge of a strange and unusual looking patch of trees.
- Tree Patch The party can see an out of place looking patch of trees ahead, as it turns out a friendly sprite Frostbite Ambersky is trying to start a new forest here, since his old one keeps getting cut down. He will let them rest in the protect grove if they help him sow some plants or trees.
- Finasaer Mithanmyr‘s Husband. The party will find the remains of a simple wood cabin. The roof has been collapsed the walls caved in. It would appear the demons attempted to set fire to the place, but only half the building caught alight. They clearly left for some reason before the rest of the job was done. Inside can be found the remains of his Danore, crucified on wall. It would appear that they beat him mercilessly, before nailing him to the wall. But it would seem judging by the struggle marks, neither were the cause of his death. The actual cause appears to be fact he has been amateurishly gelded whilst on the cross. It is unclear if he died during the process or not, but judging by the damage, no one could survive for long either way.

## A Rude Awakening

> Whilst you are comforting Finasaer, consoling him from the loss of his husband, as well as the loss of his house and memories, some of you hear a strange noise. You look to its source, the sky, and from what you can see something is heading in your direction. The more you look in fact the more you of them you can see. A little unsure what you’re looking at you each get to your feet. By the time you realise what these are, its too late. As the first strikes the ground mere feet in front of you, you realise these are oversized canon balls, and that what ever launched them is not only big, they are carpet bombing the forest of the sleepless, and all within it. You attempt to turn and run, trying to bring Finsaer with you, but it is too late. Just as one of the hundreds of canon balls hit you, you awaken. _You each awake, exactly where you were before, rested, although you’re not entirely sure how long you have been asleep for, but you are all intact, and dont appear to have any lasting damage from your visit to the forest. But you were dreamers after all, you couldnt die. The same can not be said for the inhabitants._

# The Palace Of Nightmares

- Party will awake and find the lord of dreams passing through the main room. He will be on his way to find out what the giant quakes coming from the Forest of the Sleepless, and if they know anything about what happened. Whilst they were there. He will make a small accusation as if they have done anything.
- He will then proceed to tell the party they must venture to the palace of nightmares and confront the Prince. Also to be prepared he might not listen to reason and they may find better luck at the point of a sword.
- They will make their way back along the road from the theatre which is looking a little less, destroyed from when they first went to sleep.
- The route will have also been trimmed which will make the whole thing look a lot better than it did the first time. You wonder if perhaps being in the vicinity of the celestial might have had an effect on their rapid growth.
- Walking to path to the palace is less pleasant. The route will be a lot darker and more unpleasant. The trees will slowly wilt and die. The grass blacken and the white brick road will turn to black broken tiles. They would have once been obsidian, but it would appear the passage of time has eroded it to little more than black sand.
- The golden fence has been replaced with twisted black metal, and the path is littered with a variety of nightmare orbs.
- From a distance you can see the palace it would appear to be some form of castle, but curiously there seems to be a fair amount of smoke rising from a lower level. The castle itself stands upon a cliff edge platform, entirely unsupported, by the ground below.
- As you get closer the smell of the smoke is a mix of brimstone and sulfer. It’s rather unpleasant.

## The Map Room

Inside the map room will be two **[Dryad](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Dryad.png)** cartographers, they will appear to be working on the map. They are armed with only drawing implements and wont put up much, if any fight.

- 2x **[Dryad](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Dryad.png)**

## The Throne Room

- The prince will be here and he will be talking to his lead demon, he can be overheard saying in a deep hiss:

> Lets get this citadel moving. We need to make haste whilst Dream has been contained by the celestials. The sooner the Theatre is destroyed, along with everyone in it, the better. Besides as soon as we break through the dream plane and into Faerun, we can start the real fun. Think of it, all those people running terrified of the citadel. Us raining terror from above. It will be glorious.

- One of the demons will pipe up:

> But what of the **[Dryad](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Dryad.png)**s, we promised them we would help get the free and into the mortal plane, which is why they provided us with a dragon. And on that point, the dragon only agreed to help if we promised it all the spoils of war, once we broke through and controlled all of Faerun.

- A **[Dryad](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Dryad.png)** from the map room will walk through and he will end them violently. Using improved mage hand, the **[Dryad](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Dryad.png)** will be picked off the ground and impaired on a

> Well my shortsighted friend, I would rather we have a dragon on our side, than against us. Besides I chose my words careful, “when Faerun is under our control.” An entire world would require constant patrol to be ‘under control’ so she isnt going anywhere soon.

He will burst out laughing, and the demon will start to cackle along side.

Inside will be:

- **[Prince Of Nightmares](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Prince%20Of%20Nightmares.png)**
- 3 x **[Maw Demon](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Maw%20Demon.png)**

The prince of nightmare will fall to his knees and will beg for mercy if he is allowed to do so. He will outline he has only ever wanted power, something that most people in this room probably crave in one form or another, even Dream himself. If a mention comes up of his plans to take over the waking world, he will lie and say it was

> It was all the celestials idea…and the dragon…yes, yes, it was the dragons idea to take over everything.

This is of course a massive lie and could be perceived as such. It is up to players whether they elect to keep him alive or dead, they may even take him back to the lord of dreams.

## The Loot

The Prince Of Nightmares

- [Crimson Stone](http://localhost:8080/pages/crimsonstonepage.html)

The Demons:

- A neckless with a small severed hand, possibly child sized. A metal ring through the wrist
- A smashed jar with three pickled eyeballs.

Dryads:

- 1xInk Wells (+1 Smashed)
- 1xQuill - Celestial Eagle Feather (White Pearlescent)
- 1x [Blood Lily Flower](http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/blood%20lily%20flower.png)

Somewhere:

- [The Barrel of Sunset](http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Barrel%20of%20Sunset.png)

# Shes Going Down

## The Forest Wreckage

The castle is going down and is going to crash in the forest of the sleepless. The dragon will escape out of the wall and will save anyone else in the room with them for the right price. They have mentioned about the fact the dragon could take charge of this plane and they will come around to the idea. They will need to kill dream and **[Lucienne](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Lucienne.png)** to take control. They will be on board for the idea of ruling the land and the dreaming treasure.

On the crash Elstiana will be flung from the castle wreckage and will found both a crimson stone and the Barrel of Sunset.

Either way they can take comfort in the fact a ship can be seen in the harbour called ‘daybreak’ this will be the passage home to the waking world.

Elstiana will also start to feel the urge of the crimson stone a bit more.

> Bidding fairwell to the dreaming and stand upon the deck of daybreak. Your time here has been memorable, well as memorable as a dream can be. As you sail towards the horizon, you are not sure at what point you blacked out, but it was somewhere between the sun cresting the horizon and the stars fading from the sky. You feel the warmth of your bed once more, and awaken in the room you left. Everything is where it should be, and everything you had seems to be with you…mostly. The more you try to remember the dreaming, and your time there, the more you seem to forget. You do however seem to have retained all your items, except for the curious carats. They appear to be gone.
