# The Forge of Fury

Two centuries ago, the great dwarf smith Durgeddin the Black and his clan were driven from their home by a horde of fierce orcs and trolls. They plundered the dwarves’ ancestral halls and slew all they could catch. Fleeing his enemies, Durgeddin led the destitute remnants of his clan in search of a new home. After years of wandering, the dwarves discovered a great cavern system beneath the Stone Tooth: a rugged, forested hill crowned by a bare rocky crag. There Durgeddin and his followers founded the stronghold of Khundrukar.

About a century ago, a member of Durgeddin’s clan was captured by a powerful orc tribe during a raid, and the orcs learned of their enemy’s hidden stronghold. The orc chieftains raised a great army and marched on Khundrukar. In a hard-fought siege lasting month, the orcs tunnelled around the dwarven defences. When they finally stormed the place, they put all within to the sword, then carried off wagonloads of booty.

In the years since the great battle, various creatures have occupied the stronghold and used the place as a base for their raids. At other times, the caverns have lain empty except for the mindless and bloodthirsty monsters that haunt such places. Today legends of Durgeddin’s Vengeance (or the Smith’s War) and the extraordinary blades the dwarves forged in anger still surface from time to time in the lands near the Stone Tooth.

## Preface

> You awaken in the scratching post once more, your home away from home, having had a somewhat restful night. Yesterday was a long day of travelling, rounded off with freeing a possessed girl and fighting a bundle of limbs down in Ulgoths Beard. A place, you hope you won’t have to visit any time soon.
>
> On the way past Cedars door, you give it a knock so you can all head down to breakfast together, but are met with no reply. This is somewhat unusual for Cedar, especially considering the company Cedar keeps in the form of Flo the horse, and the Awakened Living wood Sapling. You knock ones more, and the door slowly creaks open.
>
> Inside you find an empty room and made bed, with two small pouches laid at the foot. One reads ‘Elvis’ the other ‘Elstiana’.

Cedar has decided to leave the party, partly due to direction the group have taken of late, partly to explore his own interests. Behind he has left a torn note for Elvis, and a couple of items that he hopes Elstiana may find useful. Everything else, he has taken with him, including his sizable amount of gold.

> Somewhat shaken by your companion’s sudden departure, you as a group head down stairs to eat, and find a lone figure sitting at a table, watching the stairs. They have a drink of water and the innkeeper looks somewhat unimpressed they are not eating anything.
>
> They are a fairly young-looking dwarf, with a big reddish-brown plaited beard. Their long hair has been scraped back into a messy bun, and they are dressed in well-polished chainmail. Upon the table rests a very big, well maintained great axe, which glimmers and shines with a variety of colours.

# Chapter 1: The Shadow Summons

The adventure begins with the party having been summoned to the Shadow Thieves Guild curtesy of their new companion Thorny. Thorny will have a note which will outlines a call for all party members to visit the guild on a matter of some urgency. This is not the first time the characters will have entered the Shadow Thieves Guild, having been granted entry recently due to their stellar work with the Prisoner 13 Bounty for the Black Dragon Guild, but this will be the first time they have been summoned here for a job.

After the party arrive at the Shadow Thieves Guild, read the following:

> You enter the Shadow Thieves Guildhall, having provided the various secret passwords and seals to be worthy of entry. The guildhall is busy today, and it would seem there is plenty of activity in both the black market, as well as in the common rooms. The guild is preparing for something, but it’s not entirely clear what. Several thieves can even be seen sparing with one another.
>
> Although despite the sounds of the thieves giving it everything they have, that is not what catches your attention. Towards the back of the room stands an ornately dressed member of the Thieves Guild, who is clearly waiting for you. They have long blonde hair, and are wearing green robes with a red cloak. They are standing with purpose and authority.

The figure is Aran Linvail, a blonde Human male wearing green robes and a red cloak. He stands with purpose and is not one to suffer fools lightly. He is currently trying to deal with a guild war back on the mainland of Baldur’s Gate, between him and Bodhi (Elven Vampire) and her Vampires. He has summoned the party here, to see if they would be willing to take part in a bounty on behalf of the guild, as they have need of some of the loot contained within the vault if they plan to repeal the attacks from Bodhi.

> Greetings and Welcome, my name is Aran Linvail, I am the Guild master here and I appreciate you coming at such short notice, thank you Thorny for delivering the message, it is appreciated. Although it looks like you are one member short?
>
> He Pauses for a moment, before continuing.
>
> I have summoned you here as the guild has need of your services. As you can see, our guild is currently preparing for a very important mission and I simply do not have the talent required to spare, so I was hoping you might be willing to help me out.

He will hand the party a scroll which will explain the bounties history and detail, and then he will wait for the inevitable _reward_ conversation.

He will be more than happy to provide the location of the stronghold, and as for a reward, the guild would be willing to negotiate a split on any items recovered, as well as to discuss preferential rates at the Black Market, that is, as long as they don’t try to deceive the guild. After all, the guild has eyes everywhere. The guild will provide horses and the directions to the location of the stronghold, and they can be ready to leave immediately.

# Chapter 2: Approaching Khundrukar

When the characters set forth on their journey, read:

> As you travel north from Gullet Cove, you pass through brooding pine forests and deep vales. From where you stand now, you catch sight of a tall, steep hill that rises to a prominent bare knob of rock, the Stone Tooth. A thin spire of smoke rises from some unseen point high on the hill’s slopes, and you can make out a steep, narrow road or track that runs back and forth across the face of the mountainside.

At the foot of the Stone Tooth, a carefully constructed path winds up the hillside to some unseen height above. Durgeddin’s clan concealed its presence as much as possible, but years of wind and rain have eroded away its cover, leaving the path exposed and visible from the valley floor below. The path climbs to the Mountain Door, which is features a giant stone barricade blocking the entrance. To gain entrance, one must force the door with all their strength. This is not the original door built by the dwarves and is in fact he product of the Orc tribe that has moved in.

## The Mountain Door

The uppermost level of Khundrukar, called the Mountain Door, is a natural cavern that was expanded and improved upon by Durgeddin’s folk, who created a series of halls and guard chambers that protect the entrance to their realm. The place is still well fortified, even to this day.

This former dwarven strongpoint is now occupied by a band of orc raiders, led by a fierce ogre who calls himself **[Great Ulfe](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Great%20Ulfe.png)**. These raiders emerge from the Mountain Door to hunt and pillage in the surrounding area. To keep their lair secure, the orcs have blocked access to the lower levels of Khundrukar, and they rarely encounter the other denizens of the cave system.

![The Mountain Door Locations](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Adventures/ImageMaps/KhundrukarL1.html)

### 1. End of the Trail

> The entrance to Khundrukar is little more than an old dwarven path that ascends to a cleft in the hillside. It consists of an old jagged rock path which is littered with debris and rubbish lie. Discarded water skins, bits of charred bone, and splintered casks or kegs, it’s a mess, and with what knowledge you have, you know that no self-respecting dwarf clan would leave a place like this.

### 2. The Dwarf-Door

Moving eastward the trail rises steeply through a cleft in the rock toward a grand entrance.

> Shallow steps lead up through a steep fissure to the south and turn east into the mountainside. Here, a broad entranceway has been carved out of the stone. Marble steps cracked with age and veined with green moss lead up to a strong double door of carved stone, eight feet wide and almost ten feet tall. Just the other side of the door two large humanoid figures can be seen, they have their backs to you, and as far as you are aware, have not noticed your presence.

**_Creatures._** Two **[Orcs](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Orc.png)** stand guard just other side of the wooden doors, though they aren’t paying as much attention to their duties as they should. The characters (or their advance scout) can spot them from as far as 60 feet away. The sentries, Wark and Thark, are grumbling in the Orc language about someone named Ulfe. Apply a −2 penalty to the orcs’ passive Perception scores.

**_Arrow Trap._** When the characters move to walk upon the stairs they may accidentally stand on a bolt trap, which will shoot _[Void Arrows](http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Void%20Arrows.png)_ from a hole in the wall at the players. By examining the wall and making a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character notices the slits. Or a DC17 investigation check may notice the pressure plate on the floor.

**_Developments._** If they are attacked or confronted by more than one character, Wark and Thark call out a warning that’s heard by the orc in _area 4_ and then attempt to flee to _area 3_. See the “Mountain Door Defences” sidebar.

> Mountain Door Defences
>
> The orcs are well prepared for a frontal assault on the Mountain Door. They follow the sequence of activity described below to the best of their ability unless prevented or interrupted by the player characters.
>
> **_Round 1._** After sounding the alarm, the sentries in area 1 (Wark and Thark) flee south to area 2.
>
> **_Round 2._** The orcs in area 4 fire at any exposed characters in area 1 if they have been alerted by the sentries. Wark and Thark flee through the door into area 3.
>
> **_Round 3._** Wark and Thark cross the rope bridge in area 3. The orcs in area 4 continue to fire at characters in areas 1 and 2. One orc from area 4 moves through the secret door leading to area 3, intending to close and bar the double doors leading to area 2.
>
> **_Round 4._** Wark and Thark slip through to area 5 to spread the alarm, alerting the orcs in areas 11 and 14.
>
> **_Round 5._** The orc that shut the double doors in area 3 moves to area 4 or 4a while the other archers continue to fire at exposed characters. The orcs in the eastern half of area 3 cut the rope bridge and prepare to defend the doors that lead to area 5.
>
> **_Round 8_**. The orcs in area 14 arrive in area 5.
>
> **_Round 12._** Great Ulfe and the orcs from area 11 move to area 5 to ready a counterattack.

### 3. The Rift Hall

> The great door opens into a large hall. A narrow ledge overlooks a deep, dark crevasse that cuts the room in two. A dangerous-looking rope bridge, frayed and thin, spans the gap. Water gurgles and rushes somewhere far below. Two copper braziers burn brightly on either side of the door, illuminating the western half of the room. Another ledge is barely visible on the other side of the chasm.

The hall beyond the doors, and the great crevasse that runs through it, once served as the last line of defence for Khundrukar’s dwarves.

**_Creatures._** Two **[Orcs](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Orc.png)** guard the eastern side of the room. They do everything in their power to prevent the characters from getting across the bridge. If any of the party members have Darkvision or a means of illuminating the far side, read:

> Two brutish humanoids stand watch on the other side of the crevasse. They snarl a challenge, revealing yellowed tusks, and prepare to hurl javelins at you!

**_Rope Bridge._** The bridge is safe structurally, despite its appearance. Crossing under fire is difficult enough to require DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks. On a successful check, a character can move at half speed. On a failed check, a character makes no progress. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character must make a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the character plummets almost 200 feet to the underground river below and is swept away. The characters can prevent falls by roping themselves to a stable attachment point before crossing.

**_Developments._** The orcs use the rock outcroppings on their side for shelter from attacks, gaining half cover. They throw their javelins at characters trying to cross the bridge, or at those who hang back to cast spells or make ranged attacks. A character on the bridge who is hit by an attack must make a saving throw to avoid a fall, just as if the character’s Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to move along the bridge had failed by 5 or more.

If an intruder gets at least two-thirds of the way across the bridge, one orc breaks cover to move through the double doors into _area 5_ and get help. The other tries to hinder the characters by chopping at the bridge’s support ropes with its great axe. Each rope has 8 hit points and AC 11. If one support rope is cut, the DC of the Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to cross the bridge increases to 12, and characters on the bridge must immediately make a saving throw to avoid falling as described above. If both ropes are cut, the east end of the bridge drops into the crevasse and slams into the cliff wall on the west side. Any characters on the bridge take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from the impact with the wall and must make successful DC 12 Strength or Dexterity saving throws to avoid losing their grip and falling if they aren’t otherwise secured.

**_Development._** If the orcs destroy the bridge but repel the invaders in doing so, **[Great Ulfe](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Great%20Ulfe.png)**’s followers rebuild it within three days. Any orcs killed here are replaced by orcs from _area 11_.

### 4 and 4a. Trap Stations

These tunnels off to the side allow the defenders access to the traps to both maintain, and disable them as required. The mechanisms are currently set to fire upon anyone, because it would seem the orc occupiers haven’t the understanding to change that.

**_Development._** There appears to be three settings on the traps, the first is to fire upon anyone who steps upon the pressure plate, the second is to be only fire on those who do not have a specific ward/stone upon their person (This is a detect magic situation). The third is to disable them entirely. This is something that those with high roles, or an experience in traps may be able to notice. To all others, it seems the only logical way to disable them, or change the settings it to destroy them.

### 5. Orc Cave

> The walls and floor of this natural cave have been carefully smoothed. You can discern at least four routes leading off into darkness. Red coals glow from within the south-eastern passageway, and a crude wooden cage door closes off the southern exit. The floor is covered with sleeping furs, crates, sacks, and rubbish.

**_Cage Door._** The cage door to the south leads to area 6, where two prisoners languish under the orcs’ indifferent care. The prisoners leap to their feet and rush to the cage door to cry for help when the characters enter area 5.

**_Treasure._** The crates and sacks in this room contain mundane supplies looted from the countryside—flour, grain, nails, and so on. The total value is about 20 gp for about 500 pounds of material. Additionally, if characters are held captive in area 6, their equipment is stored here.

### 6. Prisoner Cave

The orcs occasionally capture miners, settlers, and merchants traveling through the forests to the south. They keep their captives in a small pen until they put them to death or ransom them.

> A row of rough-hewn sapling trunks forms a crude but serviceable barrier across the mouth of this small cave. A door locked with an iron padlock secures the room. Inside, you see two filthy prisoners dressed in tattered rags, crowding close to the door. “Thank Yondalla!” one cries out. “We’re rescued!”

**_Creatures._** The prisoners are a pair of human **[commoners](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/commoner.png)** named Geradil and Courana. They hail from a small settlement to the south, Grayvale, and the orcs have held them captive for two months now. Neither one’s family could raise the ransom demanded by their captors, so both await a terrible death at the orcs’ hands.

Opening the cage door requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, the key from Old Yarrack’s pocket (see _area 14_), or a sharp axe and a little time. (The padlock has AC 19 and 5 hit points.) Geradil and Courana are extremely grateful for their rescue, but they will not join the characters in their quest—neither is skilled at fighting, and they just want to go home.

**_Treasure._** The characters can free the prisoners and escort them back to their homes (about a day’s travel away). The grateful families reward them with two _[Potions Of Healing](http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Potion%20Of%20Healing.png)_. Taking the time to see Geradil and Courana to safety, however, gives the orcs a chance to prepare for the next assault.

**_Development._** Any characters captured by the orcs eventually wind up in the cage, unless they demonstrate that they’re too much trouble to be left alive. Their gear is stored among the other supplies in _area 5_. New characters joining the party might also be introduced as prisoners here.

### 7. Fire in the Hole

The irregular chamber southeast of the main cave holds the main cooking fire of the tribe. A crevice in its ceiling winds up through the rock to the natural chimney on the hilltop above (see “_The Stone Tooth_” above).

> A large, smoky fire crackles in the centre of this room. Battered pots and kettles are stacked all over; clearly, this space serves as a crude kitchen. You feel a distinct draft drawing the smoke up through a rough hole in the ceiling.

The characters might attempt to descend into the area through the chimney. The shaft is about 80 feet long; its walls are irregular and rough but slippery, requiring successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks to climb. Anchoring a rope at the top of the shaft reduces the check DC to 5. A careful climber can easily avoid the fire on the way down.

If a character’s check fails by 5 or more, the character must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or fall the rest of the way down the chimney. In addition to falling damage, the character takes an extra 3 (1d6) fire damage from the hot coals and makes enough noise to alert any orcs in area 5.

### 8. Orc Commons

> Haphazard stacks of crates, barrels, sacks, and bundles crowd this long cavern. To the north, two finished stone passageways open to the east and west; a narrower opening leads south. In the southeast corner is an old well full of murky water.

The cavern is full of plunder from the orcs’ raids through the surrounding area: foodstuffs, ale, blankets, tools, timber, pitch, nails, wool, and similar goods.

**_Iron Gate._** The passage leading east is blocked about 10 feet in by tightly packed crates and sacks of flour. Removing this material allows travel for another 20 feet to the east, where the tunnel ends at an iron gate stuffed with blankets and straw pallets. The orcs created these barricades to prevent the stirges in _area 10_ from getting out.

The iron gate’s lock is rusted shut; it can be picked with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check by a character using thieves’ tools or forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength check.

**_Secret Doors._** The passage to the south branches in a Y shape. The southwest branch connects to _area 5_, and the southeast one leads to a secret door cleverly constructed to blend into the natural rock of the cave. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers the door.

On the other side, a worked passage continues up to what appears to be a blank wall, marked with hexes and curses in Orc. The markings conceal another secret door, which requires a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check to find.

**_Treasure._** The mundane supplies have a total value of about 20 gp for about 500 pounds of material.

With a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character finds a loose stone. Behind it is hidden a small locked strongbox containing 180 gp and a _[Holy Water (flask)](<http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Holy%20Water%20(flask).png>)_. This is the personal treasure of Old Yarrack (see _area 11_).

### 9. Shaman’s Lair

> The secret door pivots open to reveal a chamber of finished stonework. The room is cluttered with crude furnishings, and the air is hazy with the smoke of a small cooking fire. Dozens of yellowed skulls are suspended from the ceiling by fraying ropes strung through holes punched in the bone. An orc in a ragged black robe looks up from her work, her face twisted in an expression of rage.

**_Creatures._** Burdug the shaman, an \***\*[Orc Eye of Gruumsh](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Orc%20Eye%20of%20Gruumsh.png)\*\***, has commandeered a chamber as her private domain. She lives here with her two followers, female **[Orcs](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Orc.png)**, separate from the rest of the tribe.

The door to area 10 is locked, but the key is inserted in the keyhole on this side. Burdug keeps the door closed because she wants to confine the stirges on the other side. (She calls the stirges her “little stingies” and occasionally captures one to use in her potions and brews.)

Burdug orders her two followers to engage intruders while she attempts to neutralize a dangerous-looking combatant with a _[Command](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/command.png)_ spell. Then she casts _[Bless](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/bless.png)_ on herself and the others, and finally casts _[Spiritual Weapon](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Spiritual%20Weapon.png)_ before joining battle.

If the fight goes poorly, Burdug throws _[Alchemist's Fire (flask)](<http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Alchemist's%20Fire%20(flask).png>)_ (she has three flasks) and opens the door to area 10, releasing the **[Stirges](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Stirge.png)**. She takes advantage of the confusion, using more alchemist’s fire if necessary, to escape and seek help.

**_Treasure._** A character who makes a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check finds two leather sacks among the clutter, each containing 160 sp. If Burdug is defeated, the characters can recover any of her three flasks of _[Alchemist's Fire (flask)](<http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Alchemist's%20Fire%20(flask).png>)_ that weren’t used.

**_Secret Exit._** A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check is required to find the secret door on the west wall. It connects to the passage leading toward area 8; the secret door farther along the passage to the west isn’t concealed from this side.

### 10. The Grand Stair

> The ceiling soars thirty feet high in the centre of this impressive chamber, and the walls are carved with images of dwarves at their forges. Two large stone doors exit to the north and south. Several old skeletons lie scattered near the northern door. A gate of wrought iron stands in the western wall.
>
> In the centre of the floor, a natural rift descends sharply. Dozens of stone steps lead down into darkness. You can hear the distant sound of running water and a curious buzzing coming from far below.

**_Creatures._** If the characters aren’t trying to be quiet, four hungry **[Stirges](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Stirges.png)** attack.

> The buzzing grows louder, and then four things resembling insectoid bats emerge from the stairwell and fly toward you!

![](../../EnchantedForge/ImageAssets/AdvAssets/Adv%205.1%20img3.webp)

Large quantities of smoke discourage the stirges, and they don’t move closer than 5 feet from a source of fire (including characters set alight by the trap described below). Sated stirges flap off to digest their meal down in the lower areas.

The door to the south connects to area 9 and is locked from the other side. The lock can be picked from this side by someone who makes a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, but doing so pushes the key out on the other side and warns Burdug the shaman that someone’s coming.

**_Fire Trap._** The door to the north is carved in the image of a glowering dwarf’s face. Hinges are visible. On either side of the door, eight small spouts are carefully worked into the stonework about 10 feet above the floor.

The skeletons near the door are those of orcs killed by the trap long ago; their remains show signs of severe scorching. Rusted axe heads lie near the bodies, with no sign of the weapons’ hafts.

If the door is pulled open before the trap is disabled, a counterweight drops and pumps a flammable substance resembling alchemist’s fire from the spouts. Each creature within 15 feet of the door takes 10 (4d4) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. At the start of each of its turns thereafter, an affected creature takes 5 (2d4) fire damage. A creature can fight the flames around itself by making a successful DC 10 Dexterity check as an action; a successful check reduces the fire damage it takes at the start of each of its turns to 2 (1d4). Making another successful Dexterity check as an action quenches the flames around the creature entirely.

After the door is opened, the counterweight pulls it shut again in 2 rounds, resetting the trap. The characters can prevent this from happening by jamming the door open. If the trap resets, it can be activated only once more before its fiery substance is depleted.

The spouts on the wall can be detected by someone who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check afterward, a character deduces that they form part of a trap mechanism. A character who makes a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, or someone who tightly plugs the holes with durable material, renders the trap inactive. Someone who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check while examining the door identifies the counterweight mechanism that activates the trap; it can be deactivated afterward by someone who makes a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.

**_Development._** Inspecting the small room behind the door reveals the full extent of the trap’s counterweight mechanism, as well as a system of pipes that connect the spouts to two 20-gallon copper drums (containing the substance for the fire trap).

A character who is proficient in the use of alchemist’s supplies might be able to craft alchemist’s fire from the dregs of the tanks. Doing so requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence check after the character finishes a long rest. On a successful check, the character salvages 1d4 flasks of alchemist’s fire. On a failed check, the reagents are mixed improperly, spoiling the batch; no further attempt to use these reagents can be made. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character is affected as though hit by _[Alchemist's Fire (flask)](<http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Alchemist's%20Fire%20(flask).png>)_.

### 11. Orc Quarters

> Barrels, crates, and sacks line the walls of this chamber. Among the loot, four oversized straw pallets and other simple furnishings show that it now serves as a bunk room. Four bestial humanoids with feral eyes are cleaning their weapons and mending their gear; they spring to their feet and roar in challenge.

**_Treasure._** The supplies stockpiled here are the same as those in _areas 5_ and _8_: trade goods and staples raided from travellers and nearby settlements.

**_Development._** If the characters try to rest in this space, they will be awoken by two Orcs who have been out on patrol.

![](../../EnchantedForge/ImageAssets/AdvAssets/Adv%205.1%20img4.webp)

### 12. Great Ulfe

> A short flight of stairs leads up to a large, iron-bound door. A bloodstained human skull is fixed to the centre of the door by an iron spike.

The door isn’t locked, but it is heavy and hard to move; a successful DC 17 Strength check is needed to force it open.

> Beyond the door lies a small chamber covered in poorly cured animal hides and illuminated by smoking torches in bronze sconces. The smell is indescribable. A monstrous creature about ten feet in height steps forward, a massive axe in one hand. Two huge wolves’ strain at chains held closely in its other hand. “You think to challenge the Great Ulfe?” the creature booms. “Vak! Thrag! At them!”
>
> It drops the chains and, as the wolves spring forward, it charges at you with a roar of rage.

**_Creatures._** **[Great Ulfe](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Great%20Ulfe.png)** is a fierce **[Ogre](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Ogre.png)** who leads the orcs of the Mountain Door. The chamber he claims as his own once belonged to the dwarf watch-captain.

If the characters fail to open the door on the first attempt, **[Great Ulfe](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Great%20Ulfe.png)** is alerted to their presence. He releases his two **[Dire Wolves](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Dire%20Wolf.png)**, Vak and Thrag, and takes the Ready action to attack the first enemy who enters the room. He is armed with a great axe instead of a great club: +6 to hit; 17 (2d12 + 4) slashing damage on a hit. **[Great Ulfe](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Great%20Ulfe.png)** neither asks nor gives quarter, but if the ogre falls, the wolves attempt to flee.

**_Development._** If the characters defeat **[Great Ulfe](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Great%20Ulfe.png)** but leave any orcs alive, one of the surviving orcs claims leadership of the tribe. If at least half the orcs in the tribe are slain in addition to Ulfe, any survivors abandon the dungeon after the party leaves. They become roving bands of raiders that the adventurers might have to deal with later.

**_Treasure._** **[Great Ulfe](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Great%20Ulfe.png)** keeps his hoard in two large wooden chests against the south wall: 40 gp, 160 sp.

### 13. Dwarven Statue

> At the end of the passage stands a statue of a fierce-looking dwarf in heavy mail armour. The stone warrior holds a sword in one hand and a smith’s hammer in the other. The statue is about seven feet tall and stands on a large stone pedestal.

The statue is part of another trap designed to thwart invaders of the citadel. All the denizens of the Mountain Door know about the trap and avoid triggering it.

If any character approaches within 5 feet of the statue without disarming the trap, read:

> Suddenly, you feel a small click from the floor beneath your feet. The statue’s bearded face slides open, like an oversized nutcracker, and greenish gas billows forth.

**_Poison Gas Trap._** A pressure plate is set into the floor about 5 feet in front of the statue. When at least 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, it depresses into the floor, opening the statue’s face to reveal a nozzle from which poison gas sprays out in a 15-foot cone. Each affected creature must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the creature finishes a short rest.

Someone who examines the proper location and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the pressure plate. A successful DC 12 Dexterity check by a character using thieves’ tools disarms the trap; the pressure plate can also be deactivated by physically jamming it so that it can’t move.

If the trap isn’t deactivated, it resets automatically after 1 minute.

### 14. Bunk Room

A large chamber, once the principal bunk room for dwarf guards posted in this part of the dungeon, has been appropriated by **[Great Ulfe](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Great%20Ulfe.png)**’s orcs. Up to eleven of the creatures live here, but at the moment a group of them are out raiding the countryside nearby, and three others are on duty in _area 4_.

> This chamber is filled with rough-hewn bunks, tables, and chairs, and the floor is strewn with filthy pelts. At first glance it appears that a dozen or so humanoids might use this area as a sleeping quarters.

**_Creatures._** Only Old Yarrack the **[Orog](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Orog.png)** and four **[Orcs](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Orc.png)** are at home when the characters enter the chamber. They enter combat as soon as they’re aware of intruders.

If the battle goes poorly for the orcs, Old Yarrack orders an orc to break off and summon help from _area 9_. If things get desperate, he sends for help from the orcs in _area 11_. If the orcs here fall, Yarrack attempts to join **[Great Ulfe](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Great%20Ulfe.png)**’s forces in _area 12_. The orog carries a _[Potion Of Healing](http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Potion%20Of%20Healing.png)_ and drinks it if his current hit points drop to one-fourth his hit point maximum or lower.

**_Secret Door._** The orcs don’t know about the secret door in the western wall, but a character who searches the spot can discover it with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

**_Treasure._** A successful DC 10 Wisdom check reveals a loose stone on the south wall, concealing a sack that holds 250 sp and 40 gp. Aside from his _[Potion Of Healing](http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Potion%20Of%20Healing.png)_, Old Yarrack keeps his personal treasure in _area 8_.

Old Yarrack carries the key to the cage door in _area 6_.

# Chapter 3: The Foundry

Durgeddin’s followers lived and worked in a series of carved halls and chambers beyond the Mountain Door. Most of this part of the complex was thoroughly ransacked when the dwarven citadel fell.

Unlike the Mountain Door, which offer exits to the surface world, the Foundry isn’t readily accessible. The area isn’t abandoned, though. Undead horrors wait in its darkest recesses, and dwarf-crafted traps still work perfectly well despite their age.

![The Foundry Locations](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Adventures/ImageMaps/KhundrukarL2.html)

### 35. Chamber of Statues

> The stairs end at the entrance to an octagonal chamber. The floor is inlaid with cracked, dusty blue tiles, and the walls are dressed with polished marble. Large carved wooden panels can be seen on the north west and northeast walls, with an iron door to the east which is firmly shut.
>
> Three cast bronze statues, almost ten feet tall, stand by the west, north, and east walls. Each depicts an armed dwarf. The eastern and western ones carry axes and shields. The centre statue is armed with two axes. The ceiling rises in a dome almost thirty feet above the floor.
>
> Upon the door is the phrase: “_Speak the Creators Name”_

The door will not open, it will not budge to any form of lock picking. Upon the statue bases are the three passages below, and upon the door is the phrase “_Speak the Creators Name, or else”._

> Born in the fires of the ancient forge,
> With the power of art and creation.

> Being used for creation and destruction,
> Forging armour, axes, shields and more.

> I am but a lump of iron,
> Yet I am the creator of these great halls

The word ‘Hammer’ must be spoken, as a single and correct solution. If the incorrect answer occurs, it sets off the trap.

**_Poison Gas Trap._** When triggered an opening in the statue’s face to reveal a nozzle from which poison gas sprays out in a 15-foot cone. Each affected creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be knocked out for 5 minutes. If the trap isn’t deactivated, it resets automatically after 1 minute.

### 36. The Great Hall

At the top of the stairs from area 35 is a stone door carved with a glowering dwarf’s face. It opens easily.

> This enormous hall is lined with ten great pillars, carved into the forms of giants and dragons, that support the vaulted ceiling high above. Guttering orange torches set in sconces along the walls illuminate the room, and a mighty throne sits on a dais at the opposite end. The walls were once covered with tile mosaics, but they have been smashed and defiled by graffiti. Tiny fragments of tile litter the floor. You can see five other exits. What remains of an old fire sits on the floor before the dais, where six sleeping pallets lie empty, surrounded by old packs and supplies. These have not been used in many moons.

The cavern was formerly Durgeddin’s throne room, banquet hall, and centre of authority. Its ceiling is 30 feet high, and the sconces are 10 feet above the floor. The throne is unremarkable: a short bench of stone that might have been decorated at some point in the past. The graffiti consists of crude epithets in the Orc language insulting dwarves and their ancestry.

The door leading from to _area 42_ bears an inscription in Orc: “Beyond this door the Maker of Death is chained. May he gnaw on his own hate until the sun dies and all things end.”

### 37. The Blade works

In what was Durgeddin’s smithy and workplace, the duergar are currently engaged in a secret project, hoping to capture a spark of the master smith’s vengeful magic.

> Double stone doors lead into a barrel-vaulted area containing several furnaces. The eastern end of the chamber continues into a large, dark cave, from which a cold wind moans. A stream of water rushes from west to east through the centre of the room, crossed by two stone bridges. On the other side of the stream, an old anvil sits with what remains of the hilt of a sword.

The forge itself could, be easily lit again, and it would seem has been lit recently, but unless you have the talent for forging, it would do you no good.

**_Treasure._** In the cold forge in the northwest corner of the room, there is a small stash of 10 sp, and a gold necklace set with simple stones worth 3 gp to the right person, and a _[Potion Of Hill Giant Strength](http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Potion%20Of%20Hill%20Giant%20Strength.png)_.

### 38. The Chasm

> The stream running through the old dwarven blade works meanders through a natural cavern before tumbling into a great chasm. You can see nothing but darkness below, although the splashing of waters deep below is barely audible over the roar of the waterfall. You estimate the drop is at least 500 feet, but it may be more. It is possible this was an old dwarven mine, but it’s hard to say for sure.
>
> To the north of the chasm, a small ledge is partially hidden by a spur of rock.

There is no safe way to descend and any attempt to do so would result in almost certain death. As you peer over the edge, you hear a faint rumble in the deep. You’re not sure what it was, but you hope to not find out.

### 38a. Rope Ladder

The rock spur on the northern ledge partially conceals an old chain ladder that would have led down into the pit at one point, but after little more than two or three rungs, the ladder ends. A character who makes a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check can spot the fact that the rope, whilst old, was actually once cut, rather than frayed with age.

### 39. Council Chamber

The old dwarven council chambers would have once been a hive of activity, although these days they have been looted and ransacked.

> The door behind the throne leads into a small audience chamber. A large table made of a single stone slab dominates the room's centre, and old tapestries cling to the walls. A stone door in the far wall is carved with the dwarf's visage that you've seen elsewhere. Where once a great map would have laid across the stone slap, all that remains is old decaying parchment.

### 40. Durgeddin's Quarters

Durgeddin led a spartan lifestyle, eschewing rich decorations and treasures in his personal quarters.

> This room appears to be a bedchamber. In one corner to the south stands a large wooden sleeping platform, badly gouged by axe blows and partially burned. A table, a bench, and a writing desk have been similarly treated. In the middle of the southern wall, a space has been cleared for a simple sleeping pallet and a pair of large satchels. Two doors exit the room to the north.

The door in the northwest corner leads to a bathing area, fitted with two small clay tanks to hold wash water. The northeast door opens into a closet containing the mildewed remnants of several cloaks.

### 41. Kitchens

> The stairs leading south from the pillared hall end at a wooden door. Beyond is a corridor that opens up into a large room lined with hearths. This room must once have served as the kitchen: pots, pans, cauldrons, and kettles lie scattered on the floor and strewn across several tables. An archway to the west leads into a pantry filled with rotted foodstuffs. Suddenly, you hear a scraping sound, and a big wooden table shudders and begins to move, heading right for you!

**_Creature._** An **[Animated Table](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Animated%20Table.png)** activates when someone enters the main part of the room. It fights until destroyed but won’t attack a dwarf. See the “_Arundil’s Animated Objects_” sidebar.

> Arundil’s Animated Objects
>
> A century ago, the dwarf mage Arundil animated a number of objects to defend the Foundry against intruders other than dwarves. Many of these creations remain in place today (in areas 41, _47_, and _48_).
>
> These animated objects never attack dwarves or duergar. In addition, a dwarf (including a duergar) can order an object to cease its attack. If so commanded, the object becomes immobile for 10 minutes, or until the one commanding it leaves the area.

The room is full of old, rusty iron pots, pans, cutlery, and cooking utensils, none of which are worth much.

### 42. Desecrated Shrine

Durgeddin made his last stand in Khundrukar’s shrine, laying enemies low until the orcs finally overwhelmed him. Orc shamans pronounced dire curses over his remains to ensure that their terrible foe would never return. Then they entombed a fierce orc warrior to defend it forever in undeath.

> This room was once a shrine to the gods of the dwarves. The walls are carved with their dour images, and a low stone altar stands at the western end of the room. Stone benches have been smashed and thrown askew, and the icons of the gods have been defaced.
>
> Atop the altar, arms folded over his chest, lies the ancient corpse of a dwarf warrior in plate armour. Bones lie heaped around the altar’s base, and at its foot crouches the desiccated body of an orc in studded leather.

**_Creatures._** The orc champion is now a **[Wight](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Wight.png)**, an undead monster that thirsts for life essence. Two of the piles of bones are **[Ogre Skeletons](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Ogre%20Skeleton.png)**. The ogres were slain during the final battle and later animated to join the orc warrior in his watch.

The Wight and skeletons lie immobile until someone enters. They can’t pursue characters outside room.

> Some of the bones at the foot of the altar stir and form into a pair of towering skeletons clutching great clubs. The dead orc warrior looks up at you and grins evilly, green fire burning in its hate-filled eyes as it stands.

**_Treasure._** The orcs looted the shrine after the fall of Khundrukar, but two members of the previous expedition fell to the undead defenders with valuables in their possession. Under a scattering of bones near the altar can be found a sack that holds 28 gp and a bone case that contains a _[Spell Scroll (2nd Level)](<http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Spell%20Scroll%20(2nd%20Level).png>)_ of _[Web](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Web.png)_ and a _[Spell Scroll (2nd Level)](<http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Spell%20Scroll%20(2nd%20Level).png>)_ of _[Spider Climb](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Spider%20Climb.png)_. There will also be a book with Durgeddin, which appears to have acted as a journal for him.

### 43. Entrance to the Dwarf-Halls

The dwarves of Khundrukar once resided in private rooms to the north of the great hall. When the orcs came through, they cut down all the dwarves they found and stripped the treasure out of the place.

> The door opens into a large chamber with a dark pool in the centre. Bits of smashed furniture and other debris are scattered about the floor. Hallways lead off to the east and the west.
>
> A weird moaning fills the area, slowly becoming recognizable as Dwarvish curses. The sound rises to angry shouting and grows closer. Then the translucent form of an armoured dwarf appears through a wall and attacks!

**_Creature._** Area 43, _area 46_, and all the rooms marked 44 are now the domain of the dwarf mage Arundil, who lingers as an insane **[Ghost](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Ghost.png)**.

The ghost relentlessly attacks anyone who enters its territory (most likely in either area 43 or area 46) but can’t pursue characters who retreat beyond its domain. If the ghost is turned, it flees to one of the empty rooms labelled as area 44.

**_Development._** Arundil’s ghost is tormented by grief and shame over abandoning his kin to die (see _area 47_). The spirit might be laid to rest if the characters can convince it that they have cleansed Khundrukar.

### 44. Looted Rooms

Several chambers in the Foundry were once living quarters, drawing rooms, barracks, armouries, storerooms, and so on. Now they contain only smashed furniture and debris from the final battle, graffiti in the Orc language, and skeletal remains of dwarves and orcs.

**_Treasure._** Here and there a remnant of something valuable can be salvaged from the trash. Roll a d10 the first time a character searches a given room; on a result of 10, the character uncovers a semiprecious stone (see the 10 gp Gemstones table in chapter 7 of the _Dungeon Master’s Guide_).

### 45. Skeleton Room

One of the smaller chambers once served as a small barracks. Half a dozen dwarves perished here and were later animated by Arundil (see _area 47_). He ordered them to defend their post against all intruders.

> This chamber might once have been a barracks. The remains of six wooden bunks lean against the walls, burned and hacked by pillagers, and half a dozen skeletal dwarves lie here and there on the floor. With clicking and scraping sounds, the skeletons rise and advance on you.

**_Creatures._** The six **[Skeletons](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Skeleton.png)** attack any non-undead creature that enters. They don’t pursue anyone beyond this chamber.

**_Treasure._** The rogue from the failed expedition lies in this room, her desiccated corpse half-buried under wrecked furniture. A pouch on her belt contains 670 sp.

### 46. Common Area

The open courtyard in the east end of the residential area was the site of a pitched battle between dwarves and orcs.

> The hallway leads to a large open chamber. Three doors open into it, and a dark pool fills a low stone basin in its centre. The chamber is littered with the remains of old warriors. Seven dwarf corpses lie where they fell a hundred years ago, surrounded by the remains of at least a dozen orc warriors. The dead have been stripped of their arms and armour; only a handful of broken weapons and shattered shields remain.

**_Creature._** If the characters approach this area from the secret door to the south before entering _area 43_, Arundil the **[Ghost](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Ghost.png)** confronts them here; refer to the encounter in area 43. Otherwise, there is nothing dangerous or valuable in the area.

### 47. Durgeddin’s Vault

The wall the side here is marked with a few lines of dwarven text, and ornate pattern. A **_Detect Magic_** spell would reveal that there is an evocation and illusion magic emanating from the wall behind. When the wall is touched, an arch will appear with 7 perfect circular slots in it, the carving will glow and the letters will become much clearer.

> In darkness it starts and in darkness it ends.
> It burns as it rises and as it descends.
> The in between places glow warmly, you know,
> But not he apex, the highest it goes.
> Follow its path as it travels above,
> From start to finish, all colours thereof.

The correct solution is: **_(Dark Purple, Red, Orange, Yellow, Orange, Red, Dark Purple)_**

Throughout the dungeon they will find various stones, though not all are used, it is up to the party to find the solution to reveal the treasures inside Durgeddin’s Vault.

**_Treasure._** The dwarves will have gathered significant loot 620 sp, 234 gp, an assortment of small gems totalling 127gp. A _[Wand Of Magic Missiles](http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Wand%20Of%20Magic%20Missiles.png)_, A _[Shield of the Great Badger](http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Shield%20of%20the%20Great%20Badger.png)_ bearing Durgeddin's smith-mark, A _[Jesters Bag Of Holding](http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Jesters%20Bag%20Of%20Holding.png)_, _[Robe Of Summer](http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Robe%20Of%20Summer.png)_, _[Shatterspike](http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Shatterspike.png)_, and a _[Potion Of Possibility](http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Potion%20Of%20Possibility.png)_

### 48. Durgeddin’s Vault (Looted)

Khundrukar’s armoury was looted long ago. Its door is made of iron plates, but the lock was broken during the pillaging—it can be forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength check.

> Rows of empty weapon racks and a dozen or more armour stands indicate that this room was once an armoury. Some debris litters the floor, but nothing of value is readily apparent.

**_Creature._** One of the armour stands is actually an animated object (use the **[Animated Armor](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Animated%20Armor.png)** stat block), which activates when a non-dwarf enters the room. It fights until destroyed. See “_Arundil’s Animated Objects_” above.

### 49. Dwarven Scholars Room

As you enter the room, the flickering light from your torch reveals an old and dusty study once occupied by a diligent dwarf scholar. The shelves, now weathered and decayed, once held an extensive collection of ancient tomes and scrolls, but time and neglect have taken their toll. Cobwebs hang in the corners, and the musty scent of aged parchment fills the air. The remnants of a sturdy oak desk sit against one wall, its surface covered in scattered papers and remnants of broken quills. A chair lies on its side, its wooden frame cracked from the weight of years.

Upon closer inspection, you notice a faded map pinned to the wall, depicting intricate tunnels and passageways within the dwarven city/mine. However, the details are barely legible, hinting at the once-prosperous nature of this place. A faint glimmer catches your eye, revealing a small locked drawer within the desk, which holds the promise of secrets waiting to be uncovered.

**_Treasure_**. An ornate quill can be found inside, its nothing special, and the tip needs to be replaced, but with some love it could be returned to its former glory.

**_49a (Bedchamber)._** Stepping through a creaking door, you find yourself in what appears to be the bed chamber of the scholarly dwarf. A large stone bedframe rests against one wall, its intricate carvings depicting scenes of dwarven history and achievements. The mattress, now decayed and moth-eaten, sinks under the weight of dust and time. Tattered remains of fine linens lie in disarray, a poignant reminder of the violent end that befell the former occupants.

The walls are adorned with faded tapestries, showcasing the glories of the dwarven city/mine, but their vibrant colours have long since faded to mere hints of what once was. Broken furniture litters the floor, and a bookshelf, partially collapsed, leans precariously against the wall. A single, unbroken oil lamp stands on a small, dusty table, an eerie testament to the craftsmanship of the dwarves.

**_49b (Secret Store)._** The store room requires a lot of work to open, the lock is complicated and over engineered, but sadly inside is little more than dust and torn fragments of paper.

# Chapter 4: Rumbles in The Deep

The greedy dwarves have delved too deep into the mines, and have awoken a **[Abhorrent Overlord](http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Abhorrent%20Overlord.png)**. Abhorrent overlords are gaunt, bipedal creatures whose grey, leathery skin is in stark contrast to the gleaming jewellery made of Underworld gold that they adorn themselves with. Their appetite for pain and death is eclipsed only by their greed; these fiends delight in searching out treasure and slaughtering all who stand in their way.

![](../../EnchantedForge/ImageAssets/AdvAssets/Adv%205.1%20img6.png)

> As you explore the ancient and eerily silent dwarven mine, the air becomes heavy and oppressive, and an unsettling chill runs down your spines. The walls seem to close in, and the faint echoes of your footsteps reverberate ominously through the empty corridors. Dust and debris shower down from the cavern ceiling into the deep chasm that descend endlessly into the earth.
>
> An overwhelming feeling of dread washes over you as an ancient evil stirs below. The darkness within the abyss seems to writhe and pulsate, taking on a malevolent life of its own. Then, with a gut-wrenching roar that shakes the very core of the mine, the Abhorrent Overlord bursts forth from the depths. Its massive form towers above you, blotting out the already dim light. Its skin is a grotesque mixture of abyssal black and crimson, pulsating with malevolent energy. Glowing, fiery eyes, filled with hate and malice, lock onto the intruders who have awakened it from its slumber.
>
> Prepare yourselves, for this encounter with the Abhorrent Overlord will test you in ways you least expect.

Roll for initiative. The Abhorrent Overlord will fight to the death, trying every evil trick in the book. Although they will gravitate to whoever is holding the most gold. They dont tend to care about any other currency, just gold coins.

**_Treasure._** Abhorrent Overlord has accumulated considerable wealth from their plunder of Khundrukar. Their hoard contains 220 sp, 73 gp, two garnets worth 20 gp each, a black pearl worth 10 gp, The Yellow Crystal, a _[Potion Of Healing](http://localhost:8080/Sources/MagicItems/Potion%20Of%20Healing.png)_.
