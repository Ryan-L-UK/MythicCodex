The yakfolk must touch the target throughout a short rest, or the attempt fails. At the end of the rest, the target must succeed on a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw or be possessed by the yakfolk, which disappears with everything it is carrying and wearing. Until the possession ends, the target is {@condition incapacitated}, loses control of its body, and is unaware of its surroundings. The yakfolk now controls the body and can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it retains its alignment; its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; and its proficiencies. It otherwise uses the target's statistics, except the target's knowledge, class features, feats, and proficiencies.","The possession lasts until either the body drops to 0 hit points, the yakfolk ends the possession as an action, or the yakfolk is forced out of the body by an effect such as the {@spell dispel evil and good} spell. When the possession ends, the yakfolk reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body and is {@condition stunned} until the end of its next turn. If the host body dies while it is possessed by the yakfolk, the yakfolk dies as well, and its body doesn't reappear."]}],"action":[{"name":"Multiattack","entries":["The yakfolk makes two attacks, either with its greatsword or its longbow."]},{"name":"Greatsword","entries":["{@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 4d6 + 4}) slashing damage."]},{"name":"Longbow","entries":["{@atk rw} {@hit 2} to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. {@h}9 ({@damage 2d8}) piercing damage."]}],"attachedItems":["greatsword|phb","longbow|phb"],"actionTags":["Multiattack"],"languageTags":["C","OTH"],"damageTags":["P","S"],"miscTags":["MW","RNG","RW"],"conditionInflict":["incapacitated"],"savingThrowForced":["constitution"],"hasToken":true,"hasFluff":true,"hasFluffImages":true}
