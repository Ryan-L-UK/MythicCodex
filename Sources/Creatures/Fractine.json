No other creature can enter the demiplane, and the fractine can't be harmed from within the demiplane.","The fractine can imprison only one creature at a time and can release that creature as a bonus action. If the fractine is reduced to 0 hit points, any creature in the fractine's demiplane is released instantly. A released creature reappears in an unoccupied space as close to the fractine (or where it died) as possible.
