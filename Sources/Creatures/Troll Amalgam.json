The limb has the statistics of a troll amalgam, except for the following: it is Medium, it has 45 hit points, its speed is 30 ft., it doesn't have a challenge rating or Legendary Resistance, and the only action it can take is the Attack action, which it can use only to grapple.","Until this grapple ends, the target has the {@condition restrained} condition and takes 25 ({@damage 4d8 + 7}) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns. If the limb is not destroyed within 24 hours of being flung, roll a {@dice d12}; on a roll of 12, the limb regenerates into a troll (see the Monster Manual).
